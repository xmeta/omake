8.11.1   Regular expressions
============================
   
  Many of the higher-level functions use regular expressions. Regular
expressions are defined by strings with syntax nearly identical to
awk(1).
  Strings may contain the following character constants.
  
  
 - `\\' : a literal backslash. 
 - `\a' : the alert character `^G'. 
 - `\b' : the backspace character `^H'. 
 - `\f' : the formfeed character `^L'. 
 - `\n' : the newline character `^J'. 
 - `\r' : the carriage return character `^M'. 
 - `\t' : the tab character `^I'. 
 - `\v' : the vertical tab character. 
 - `\xhh...' : the character represented by the string  of hexadecimal
   digits `h'. All valid hexadecimal digits  following the sequence are
   considered to be part of the sequence. 
 - `\ddd' : the character represented by 1, 2, or 3 octal  digits. 
  
  Regular expressions are defined using the special characters
`.\^$[(){}*?'+.
  
  
 - `c' : matches the literal character `c' if `c' is not  a special
   character. 
 - `\c' : matches the literal character `c', even if `c'  is a special
   character. 
 - `.' : matches any character, including newline. 
 - `^' : matches the beginning of a line. 
 - `$' : matches the end of line. 
 - `[abc...]' : matches any of the characters `abc...' 
 - `[^abc...]' : matches any character except `abc...' 
 - `r1|r2' : matches either `r1' or `r2'. 
 - `r1r2' : matches `r1' and then `r2'. 
 - `r'+ : matches one or more occurrences of `r'. 
 - `r*' : matches zero or more occurrences of `r'. 
 - `r?' : matches zero or one occurrence of `r'. 
 - `(r)' : parentheses are used for grouping; matches `r'. 
 - `\(r\)' : also defines grouping, but the expression matched  within
   the parentheses is available to the output processor  through one of
   the variables `$1', `$2', ... 
 - `r{n}' : matches exactly `n' occurrences of `r'. 
 - `r{n,}' : matches `n' or more occurrences of `r'. 
 - `r{n,m}' : matches at least `n' occurrences of `r',  and no more than
   `m' occurrences. 
 - `\y': matches the empty string at either the beginning or  end of a
   word. 
 - `\B': matches the empty string within a word. 
 - `\<': matches the empty string at the beginning of a word. 
 - `\>': matches the empty string at the end of a word. 
 - `\w': matches any character in a word. 
 - `\W': matches any character that does not occur within a word. 
 - `\`': matches the empty string at the beginning of a file. 
 - `\'': matches the empty string at the end of a file. 
  
  Character classes can be used to specify character sequences
abstractly. Some of these sequences can change depending on your LOCALE.
  
  
 - `[:alnum:]' Alphanumeric characters. 
 - `[:alpha:]' Alphabetic characters. 
 - `[:lower:]' Lowercase alphabetic characters. 
 - `[:upper:]' Uppercase alphabetic characters. 
 - `[:cntrl:]' Control characters. 
 - `[:digit:]' Numeric characters. 
 - `[:xdigit:]' Numeric and hexadecimal characters. 
 - `[:graph:]' Characters that are printable and visible. 
 - `[:print:]' Characters that are printable, whether they are visible
   or not. 
 - `[:punct:]' Punctuation characters. 
 - `[:blank:]' Space or tab characters. 
 - `[:space:]' Whitespace characters.

8.11.3   grep
=============

<<
     grep(pattern) : String  # input from stdin, default options
        pattern : String
     grep(pattern, files) : String  # default options
        pattern : String
        files   : File Sequence
     grep(options, pattern, files) : String
       options : String
       pattern : String
       files   : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `grep' function searches for occurrences of a regular expression
`pattern' in a set of files, and prints lines that match. This is like a
highly-simplified version of grep(1).
  The options are: 
  
 q  If specified, the output from `grep' is not displayed. 
 h  If specified, output lines will not include the filename (default,
   when only one input  file is given). 
 n  If specified, output lines include the filename (default, when more
   than one input file  is given). 
 v  If specified, search for lines without a match instead of lines with
   a match, 
  
  The `pattern' is a regular expression.
  If successful (`grep' found a match), the function returns `true'.
Otherwise, it returns `false'.

8.11.4   scan
=============

<<
     scan(input-files)
     case string1
        body1
     case string2
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The `scan' function provides input processing in command-line form.
The function takes file/filename arguments. If called with no arguments,
the input is taken from `stdin'. If arguments are provided, each
specifies an `InChannel', or the name of a file for input. Output is
always to `stdout'.
  The `scan' function operates by reading the input one line at a time,
and processing it according to the following algorithm.
  For each line, the record is first split into fields, and the fields
are bound to the variables `$1, $2, ...'. The variable `$0' is defined
to be the entire line, and `$*' is an array of all the field values. The
`$(NF)' variable is defined to be the number of fields.
  Next, a case expression is selected. If `string_i' matches the token
`$1', then `body_i' is evaluated. If the body ends in an `export', the
state is passed to the next clause. Otherwise the value is discarded.
  For example, here is an `scan' function that acts as a simple command
processor.
<<
      calc() =
         i = 0
         scan(script.in)
         case print
            println($i)
         case inc
            i = $(add $i, 1)
            export
         case dec
            i = $(sub $i, 1)
            export
         case addconst
            i = $(add $i, $2)
            export
         default
            eprintln($"Unknown command: $1")
>>
  
  The `scan' function also supports several options.
<<
      scan(options, files)
      ...
>>
  
  
  
 A  Parse each line as an argument list, where arguments  may be quoted.
   For example, the following line has three words,  ```ls''', ```-l''',
   ```Program Files'''.
   <<
            ls -l "Program Files"
        >>
 
 O  Parse each line using white space as the separator, using the  usual
   OMake algorithm for string parsing. This is the default. 
 x  Once each line is split, reduce each word using the  hex
   representation. This is the usual hex representation used  in URL
   specifiers, so the string ``Program Files'' may be  alternately
   represented in the form ProgramProgram+Files. 
  
  Note, if you want to redirect the output to a file, the easiest way is
to redefine the `stdout' variable. The `stdout' variable is scoped the
same way as other variables, so this definition does not affect the
meaning of `stdout' outside the `calc' function.
<<
      calc() =
          stdout = $(fopen script.out, w)
          scan(script.in)
             ...
          close(stdout)

8.11.5   awk
============

<<
     awk(input-files)
     case pattern1:
        body1
     case pattern2:
        body2
     ...
     default:
        bodyd
>>
  
  The `awk' function provides input processing similar to awk(1), but
more limited. The function takes filename arguments. If called with no
arguments, the input is taken from `stdin'. If arguments are provided,
each specifies an `InChannel', or the name of a file for input. Output
is always to `stdout'.
  The variables `RS' and `FS' define record and field separators as
regular expressions. The default value of `RS' is the regular expression
`\r|\n|\r\n'. The default value of `FS' is the regular expression `[
\t]'+.
  The `awk' function operates by reading the input one record at a time,
and processing it according to the following algorithm.
  For each line, the record is first split into fields using the field
separator `FS', and the fields are bound to the variables `$1, $2, ...'.
The variable `$0' is defined to be the entire line, and `$*' is an array
of all the field values. The `$(NF)' variable is defined to be the
number of fields.
  Next, the cases are evaluated in order. For each case, if the regular
expression `pattern_i' matches the record `$0', then `body_i' is
evaluated. If the body ends in an `export', the state is passed to the
next clause. Otherwise the value is discarded. If the regular expression
contains `\(r\)' expression, those expression override the fields `$1,
$2, ...'.
  For example, here is an `awk' function to print the text between two
delimiters `\begin{<name>}' and `\end{<name>}', where the `<name>' must
belong to a set passed as an argument to the `filter' function.
<<
      filter(names) =
         print = false
  
         awk(Awk.in)
         case $"^\\end\{\([:alpha:]+\)\}"
            if $(mem $1, $(names))
               print = false
               export
            export
         default
            if $(print)
               println($0)
         case $"^\\begin\{\([:alpha:]+\)\}"
            print = $(mem $1, $(names))
            export
>>
  
  Note, if you want to redirect the output to a file, the easiest way is
to redefine the `stdout' variable. The `stdout' variable is scoped the
same way as other variables, so this definition does not affect the
meaning of `stdout' outside the `filter' function.
<<
      filter(names) =
          stdout = $(fopen file.out, w)
          awk(Awk.in)
             ...
          close(stdout)

8.11.6   fsubst
===============

<<
     fsubst(files)
     case pattern1 [options]
        body1
     case pattern2 [options]
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The `fsubst' function provides a sed(1)-like substitution function.
Similar to `awk', if `fsubst' is called with no arguments, the input is
taken from `stdin'. If arguments are provided, each specifies an
`InChannel', or the name of a file for input.
  The `RS' variable defines a regular expression that determines a
record separator, The default value of `RS' is the regular expression
`\r|\n|\r\n'.
  The `fsubst' function reads the file one record at a time.
  For each record, the cases are evaluated in order. Each case defines a
substitution from a substring matching the `pattern' to replacement text
defined by the body.
  Currently, there is only one option: `g'. If specified, each clause
specifies a global replacement, and all instances of the pattern define
a substitution. Otherwise, the substitution is applied only once.
  Output can be redirected by redefining the `stdout' variable.
  For example, the following program replaces all occurrences of an
expression `word.' with its capitalized form.
<<
      section
         stdout = $(fopen Subst.out, w)
         fsubst(Subst.in)
         case $"\<\([[:alnum:]]+\)\." g
            value $(capitalize $1).

8.11.7   Lexer
==============

  The `Lexer' object defines a facility for lexical analysis, similar to
the lex(1) and flex(1) programs.
  In omake, lexical analyzers can be constructed dynamically by
extending the `Lexer' class. A lexer definition consists of a set of
directives specified with method calls, and set of clauses specified as
rules.
  For example, consider the following lexer definition, which is
intended for lexical analysis of simple arithmetic expressions for a
desktop calculator.
<<
     lexer1. =
        extends $(Lexer)
  
        other: .
           eprintln(Illegal character: $* )
           lex()
  
        white: $"[[:space:]]+"
           lex()
  
        op: $"[-+*/()]"
           switch $*
           case +
              Token.unit($(loc), plus)
           case -
              Token.unit($(loc), minus)
           case *
              Token.unit($(loc), mul)
           case /
              Token.unit($(loc), div)
           case $"("
              Token.unit($(loc), lparen)
           case $")"
              Token.unit($(loc), rparen)
  
        number: $"[[:digit:]]+"
           Token.pair($(loc), exp, $(int $* ))
  
        eof: $"\'"
           Token.unit($(loc), eof)
>>
  
  This program defines an object `lexer1' the extends the `Lexer'
object, which defines lexing environment.
  The remainder of the definition consists of a set of clauses, each
with a method name before the colon; a regular expression after the
colon; and in this case, a body. The body is optional, if it is not
specified, the method with the given name should already exist in the
lexer definition.
  NB The clause that matches the longest prefix of the input is
selected. If two clauses match the same input prefix, then the last one
is selected. This is unlike most standard lexers, but makes more sense
for extensible grammars.
  The first clause matches any input that is not matched by the other
clauses. In this case, an error message is printed for any unknown
character, and the input is skipped. Note that this clause is selected
only if no other clause matches.
  The second clause is responsible for ignoring white space. If
whitespace is found, it is ignored, and the lexer is called recursively.
  The third clause is responsible for the arithmetic operators. It makes
use of the `Token' object, which defines three fields: a `loc' field
that represents the source location; a `name'; and a `value'.
  The lexer defines the `loc' variable to be the location of the current
lexeme in each of the method bodies, so we can use that value to create
the tokens.
  The `Token.unit($(loc), name)' method constructs a new `Token' object
with the given name, and a default value.
  The `number' clause matches nonnegative integer constants. The
`Token.pair($(loc), name, value)' constructs a token with the given name
and value.
  Lexer object operate on `InChannel' objects. The method
`lexer1.lex-channel(channel)' reads the next token from the channel
argument.

8.11.8   Lexer matching
=======================
  
  During lexical analysis, clauses are selected by longest match. That
is, the clause that matches the longest sequence of input characters is
chosen for evaluation. If no clause matches, the lexer raises a
`RuntimeException'. If more than one clause matches the same amount of
input, the first one is chosen for evaluation.

8.11.9   Extending lexer definitions
====================================
  
  Suppose we wish to augment the lexer example so that it ignores
comments. We will define comments as any text that begins with the
string `(*', ends with `*)', and comments may be nested.
  One convenient way to do this is to define a separate lexer just to
skip comments.
<<
     lex-comment. =
        extends $(Lexer)
  
        level = 0
  
        other: .
           lex()
  
        term: $"[*][)]"
           if $(not $(eq $(level), 0))
              level = $(sub $(level), 1)
              lex()
  
        next: $"[(][*]"
           level = $(add $(level), 1)
           lex()
  
        eof: $"\'"
           eprintln(Unterminated comment)
>>
  
  This lexer contains a field `level' that keeps track of the nesting
level. On encountering a `(*' string, it increments the level, and for
`*)', it decrements the level if nonzero, and continues.
  Next, we need to modify our previous lexer to skip comments. We can do
this by extending the lexer object `lexer1' that we just created.
<<
     lexer1. +=
        comment: $"[(][*]"
           lex-comment.lex-channel($(channel))
           lex()
>>
  
  The body for the comment clause calls the `lex-comment' lexer when a
comment is encountered, and continues lexing when that lexer returns.

8.11.10   Threading the lexer object
====================================
  
  Clause bodies may also end with an `export' directive. In this case
the lexer object itself is used as the returned token. If used with the
`Parser' object below, the lexer should define the `loc', `name' and
`value' fields in each `export' clause. Each time the `Parser' calls the
lexer, it calls it with the lexer returned from the previous lex
invocation.

8.11.11   Parser
================
  
  The `Parser' object provides a facility for syntactic analysis based
on context-free grammars.
  `Parser' objects are specified as a sequence of directives, specified
with method calls; and productions, specified as rules.
  For example, let's finish building the desktop calculator started in
the `Lexer' example.
<<
     parser1. =
        extends $(Parser)
  
        #
        # Use the main lexer
        #
        lexer = $(lexer1)
  
        #
        # Precedences, in ascending order
        #
        left(plus minus)
        left(mul div)
        right(uminus)
  
        #
        # A program
        #
        start(prog)
  
        prog: exp eof
           return $1
  
        #
        # Simple arithmetic expressions
        #
        exp: minus exp :prec: uminus
           neg($2)
  
        exp: exp plus exp
           add($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp minus exp
           sub($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp mul exp
           mul($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp div exp
           div($1, $3)
  
        exp: lparen exp rparen
           return $2
>>
  
  Parsers are defined as extensions of the `Parser' class. A `Parser'
object must have a `lexer' field. The `lexer' is not required to be a
`Lexer' object, but it must provide a `lexer.lex()' method that returns
a token object with `name' and `value' fields. For this example, we use
the `lexer1' object that we defined previously.
  The next step is to define precedences for the terminal symbols. The
precedences are defined with the `left', `right', and `nonassoc' methods
in order of increasing precedence.
  The grammar must have at least one start symbol, declared with the
`start' method.
  Next, the productions in the grammar are listed as rules. The name of
the production is listed before the colon, and a sequence of variables
is listed to the right of the colon. The body is a semantic action to be
evaluated when the production is recognized as part of the input.
  In this example, these are the productions for the arithmetic
expressions recognized by the desktop calculator. The semantic action
performs the calculation. The variables `$1, $2, ...' correspond to the
values associated with each of the variables on the right-hand-side of
the production.

8.11.12   Calling the parser
============================
  
  The parser is called with the `$(parser1.parse-channel start,
channel)' or `$(parser1.parse-file start, file)' functions. The `start'
argument is the start symbol, and the `channel' or `file' is the input
to the parser.

8.11.13   Parsing control
=========================
  
  The parser generator generates a pushdown automation based on LALR(1)
tables. As usual, if the grammar is ambiguous, this may generate
shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts. These conflicts are printed to
standard output when the automaton is generated.
  By default, the automaton is not constructed until the parser is first
used.
  The `build(debug)' method forces the construction of the automaton.
While not required, it is wise to finish each complete parser with a
call to the `build(debug)' method. If the `debug' variable is set, this
also prints with parser table together with any conflicts.
  The `loc' variable is defined within action bodies, and represents the
input range for all tokens on the right-hand-side of the production.

8.11.14   Extending parsers
===========================
  
  Parsers may also be extended by inheritance. For example, let's extend
the grammar so that it also recognizes the `<<' and `>>' shift
operations.
  First, we extend the lexer so that it recognizes these tokens. This
time, we choose to leave `lexer1' intact, instead of using the +=
operator.
<<
     lexer2. =
        extends $(lexer1)
  
        lsl: $"<<"
           Token.unit($(loc), lsl)
  
        asr: $">>"
           Token.unit($(loc), asr)
>>
  
  Next, we extend the parser to handle these new operators. We intend
that the bitwise operators have lower precedence than the other
arithmetic operators. The two-argument form of the `left' method
accomplishes this.
<<
     parser2. =
        extends $(parser1)
  
        left(plus, lsl lsr asr)
  
        lexer = $(lexer2)
  
        exp: exp lsl exp
           lsl($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp asr exp
           asr($1, $3)
>>
  
  In this case, we use the new lexer `lexer2', and we add productions
for the new shift operations.

10.1.1   Object
===============

  Parent objects: none.
  The `Object' object is the root object. Every class is a subclass of
`Object'.
  It provides the following fields:
  
  
 - `$(o.object-length)': the number of fields and methods in the object.
   
 - `$(o.object-mem <var>)': returns `true' iff the `<var>' is a field 
   or method of the object. 
 - `$(o.object-add <var>, <value>)': adds the field to the object, 
   returning a new object. 
 - `$(o.object-find <var>)': fetches the field or method from the
   object;  it is equivalent to `$(o.<var>)', but the variable can be
   non-constant. 
 - `$(o.object-map <fun>)': maps a function over the object. The
   function  should take two arguments; the first is a field name, the
   second is the  value of that field. The result is a new object
   constructed from the  values returned by the function. 
 - `o.object-foreach': the `foreach' form is equivalent to `map',  but
   with altered syntax.
   <<
        o.foreach(<var1>, <var2>)
           <body>
        >>
 
  For example, the following function prints all the fields of an 
   object `o'.
   <<
        PrintObject(o) =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              println($(v) = $(x))
        >>
 
  The `export' form is valid in a `foreach' body. The following 
   function collects just the field names of an object.
   <<
        FieldNames(o) =
           names =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              names += $(v)
              export
           return $(names)

10.1.2   Map
============

  Parent objects: `Object'.
  A `Map' object is a dictionary from values to values. The `<key>'
values are restricted to simple values: integers, floating-point
numbers, strings, files, directories, and arrays of simple values.
  The Map object provides the following methods.
  
  
 - `$(o.mem <key>)': returns `true' iff the `<key>' is defined  in the
   map. 
 - `$(o.add <key>, <value>)': adds the field to the map,  returning a
   new map. 
 - `$(o.find <key>)': fetches the field from the map. 
 - `$(o.map <fun>)': maps a function over the map. The function  should
   take two arguments; the first is a field name, the second is the 
   value of that field. The result is a new object constructed from the 
   values returned by the function. 
 - `o.foreach': the `foreach' form is equivalent to `map',  but with
   altered syntax.
   <<
        o.foreach(<var1>, <var2>)
           <body>
        >>
 
  For example, the following function prints all the fields of an 
   object `o'.
   <<
        PrintObject(o) =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              println($(v) = $(x))
        >>
 
  The `export' form is valid in a `foreach' body. The following 
   function collects just the field names of the map.
   <<
        FieldNames(o) =
           names =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              names += $(v)
              export
           return $(names)
        >>
  
  There is also simpler syntax when the key is a string. The table can
be defined using definitions with the form `$|key|' (the number of pipe
symbols `|' is allowed to vary).
<<
      $|key 1| = value1
      $||key1|key2|| = value2    # The key is key1|key2
      X = $|key 1|               # Define X to be the value of field
$|key 1|
>>
  
  The usual modifiers are also allowed. The expression `$`|key|'
represents lazy evaluation of the key, and `$,|key|' is normal
evaluation.

10.1.6   Sequence
=================

  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Sequence' object represents a generic object containing
sequential elements. It provides the following methods.
  
  
 - `$(s.length)': the number of elements in the sequence. 
 - `$(s.map <fun>)': maps a function over the fields in the sequence. 
   The function should take one argument. The result is a new sequence 
   constructed from the values returned by the function. 
 - `s.foreach': the `foreach' form is equivalent to `map',  but with
   altered syntax.
   <<
        s.foreach(<var>)
           <body>
        >>
 
  For example, the following function prints all the elements of the
   sequence.
   <<
        PrintSequence(s) =
           s.foreach(x)
              println(Elem = $(x))
        >>
 
  The `export' form is valid in a `foreach' body. The following 
   function counts the number of zeros in the sequence.
   <<
        Zeros(s) =
           count = $(int 0)
           s.foreach(v)
              if $(equal $(v), 0)
                 count = $(add $(count), 1)
                 export

 - `effects': the files that may be modified by a  side-effect when this
   target is built. 
 - `scanner_deps': static dependencies that must be built  before this
   target can be scanned. 
 - `static-deps': statically-defined build dependencies  of this target.
   
 - `build-deps': all the build dependencies for the target,  including
   static and scanned dependencies. 
 - `build-values': all the value dependencies associated  with the
   build. 
 - `build-commands': the commands to build the target. 
  
  The object supports the following methods.
  
  
 - `find(file)': returns a Target object for the given file.  Raises a
   `RuntimeException' if the specified target is  not part of the
   project. 
 - `find-optional(file)': returns a `Target' object  for the given file,
   or `false' if the file is not  part of the project. 
  
  NOTE: the information for a target is constructed dynamically, so it
is possible that the `Target' object for a node will contain different
values in different contexts. The easiest way to make sure that the
`Target' information is complete is to compute it within a rule body,
where the rule depends on the target file, or the dependencies of the
target file.

   a symbolic link, the `stat' information is for the destination of the
   link, not the link itself.
 
 - `$(node.lstat)': returns a `stat' object for the file or symbolic
   link. 
 - `$(node.unlink)': removes the file. 
 - `$(node.rename <file>)': renames the file. 
 - `$(node.link <file>)': creates a hard link `<dst>' to this file. 
 - `$(node.symlink <file>)': create a symbolic link `<dst>' to this
   file. 
 - `$(node.chmod <perm>)': change the permission of this file. 
 - `$(node.chown <uid>, <gid>)': change the owner and group id of this
   file.

10.1.22   Shell
===============

  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Shell' object contains the collection of builtin functions
available as shell commands.
  You can define aliases by extending this object with additional
methods. All methods in this class are called with one argument: a
single array containing an argument list.
  
  
 - `echo'
 The `echo' function prints its arguments to the standard output
   channel. 
 - `jobs'
 The `jobs' method prints the status of currently running commands. 
 - `cd'
 The `cd' function changes the current directory. Note that the current
   directory follows the usual scoping rules. For example, the following
   program lists the files in the `foo' directory, but the current
   directory is not changed.
   <<
        section
           echo Listing files in the foo directory...
           cd foo
           ls
     
        echo Listing files in the current directory...
        ls
   >>
 
 - `bg'
 The `bg' method places a job in the background. The job is resumed if
   it has been suspended. 
 - `fg'
 The `fg' method brings a job to the foreground. The job is resumed if
   it has been suspended. 
 - `stop'
 The `stop' method suspends a running job. 
 - `wait'
 The `wait' function waits for a running job to terminate. It is not
   possible to wait for a suspended job.
 The job is not brought to the foreground. If the `wait' is interrupted,
   the job continues to run in the background. 
 - `kill'
 The `kill' function signal a job.
 `kill [signal] <pid...>'.
 The signals are either numeric, or symbolic. The symbolic signals are
   named as follows.
 ABRT, ALRM, HUP, ILL, KILL, QUIT, SEGV, TERM, USR1, USR2, CHLD, STOP,
   TSTP, TTIN, TTOU, VTALRM, PROF. 
 - `exit'
 The `exit' function terminates the current session. 
 - `which', `where'
 See the documentation for the corresponding functions. 
 - `rehash'
 Reset the search path. 
 - `history'
 Print the current command-line history. 
 - Win32 functions.
 Win32 doesn't provide very many programs for scripting, except  for the
   functions that are builtin to the DOS `cmd.exe'.  The following
   functions are defined on Win32 and only on Win32.  On other systems,
   it is expected that these programs already  exist.
 
     
    - `grep'
      <<
           grep [-q] [-n] pattern files...
      >>
    
    The `grep' function calls the omake `grep' function. 
  By default, omake uses internal versions of the following commands:
   `cp', `mv', `cat', `rm', `mkdir', `chmod', `test', `find'. If you
   really want to use the standard system versions of these commands,
   set the `USE_SYSTEM_COMMANDS' as one of the first definitions in your
   `OMakeroot' file.
 
     
    - `mkdir'
      <<
            mkdir [-m <mode>] [-p] files
      >>
    
    The `mkdir' function is used to create directories. The -verb+-m+
      option can be used to specify the permission mode of the created
      directory. If the `-p' option is specified, the full path is
      created. 
    - `cp' 
    - `mv'
      <<
            cp [-f] [-i] [-v] src dst
            cp [-f] [-i] [-v] files dst
            mv [-f] [-i] [-v] src dst
            mv [-f] [-i] [-v] files dst
      >>
    
    The `cp' function copies a `src' file to a `dst' file, overwriting
      it if it already exists. If more than one source file is
      specified, the final file must be a directory, and the source
      files are copied into the directory.
    
        
       -f  Copy files forcibly, do not prompt. 
       -i  Prompt before removing destination files. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
     
    - `rm'
      <<
           rm [-f] [-i] [-v] [-r] files
           rmdir [-f] [-i] [-v] [-r] dirs
      >>
    
    The `rm' function removes a set of files. No warnings are issued if
      the files do not exist, or if they cannot be removed.
    Options: 
        
       -f  Forcibly remove files, do not prompt. 
       -i  Prompt before removal. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
       -r  Remove contents of directories recursively. 
     
    - `chmod'
      <<
            chmod [-r] [-v] [-f] mode files
      >>
    
    The `chmod' function changes the permissions on a set of files or
      directories. This function does nothing on Win32. The `mode' may
      be specified as an octal number, or in symbolic form
      `[ugoa]*['-=][rwxXstugo]+. See the man page for `chmod' for
      details.
    Options: 
        
       -r  Change permissions of all files in a directory recursively. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
       -f  Continue on errors. 
     
    - `cat'
      <<
           cat files...
      >>
    
    The `cat' function prints the contents of the files to stdout 
    - `test'
      <<
           test \emph{expression}
           \verb+[+ \emph{expression} +]+
           \verb+[ --help+
           \verb+[ --version+
      >>
    
    See the documentation for the `test' function.
    
    - `find'
      <<
           find \emph{expression}
      >>
    
    See the documentation for the `find' function.
