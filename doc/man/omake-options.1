.SH COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS

.PP
.TP
\fB\-k\fP
 Do not abort when a build command fails;
continue to build as much of the project as possible.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
 Print the commands that would be executed, but do no execute them.
This can be used to see what would happen if the project were to be built.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
 Do not print commands as they are executed (be ``silent\&'').
.PP
.TP
\fB\-S\fP
 Do not print commands as they are executed \fIunless\fP
they produce output.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-progress\fP
 Print a progress indicator.
This is normally used with the \fB\-s\fP
or \fB\-S\fP
options.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-progress\fP
 Do not print a progress indicator (default).
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-exit\fP
 Print termination codes when commands complete.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-print\-exit\fP
 Do not print termination codes when commands complete (default).
.PP
.TP
\fB\-w\fP
 Print directory information in make
format as commands are executed.
This is mainly useful for editors that expect make\-style
directory information for determining the location of errors.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
 Watch the filesystem for changes, and continue the build until it succeeds. If this
option is specified, omake
will restart the build whenever source files are modified.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-P\fP
 Watch the filesystem for changes forever. If this option is specified, omake
will restart the build whenever source files are modified.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
 Ignore the current directory and build the project from its root directory. When
omake
is run in a subdirectory of a project, it normally builds files within the current
directory and its subdirectories. If the \fB\-R\fP
option is specified, the build is performed as if
omake
were run in the project root.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-t\fP
 Update the omake
database to force the project to be considered up\-to\-date.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-U\fP
 Do not trust cached build information. This will force the entire project to be rebuilt.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-depend\fP
 Do not trust cached dependency information. This will force files to be rescanned
for dependency information.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-configure\fP
 Re\-run static.\\ sections of the included omake files, instead of
trusting the cached results.
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-\-force\-dotomake\fP]
 Always use the $HOME/.omake for the \&.omc cache files.
.PP
.TP
[\fB\-\-dotomake\fP\fI dir\fP]
 Use the specified directory instead of the $HOME/.omake
for the placement of the \&.omc cache files.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-j\fP\fIcount\fP
 Run multiple build commands in parallel. The \fIcount\fP
specifies a
bound on the number of commands to run simultaneously. In addition, the count may specify servers
for remote execution of commands in the form server=count\&. For example, the option
\-j 2:small.host.org=1:large.host.org=4 would specify that up to 2 jobs can be executed
locally, 1 on the server small.host.org and 4 on large.host.org\&. Each remote server
must use the same filesystem location for the project.
.PP
Remote execution is currently an experimental feature. Remote filesystems like NFS do not provide
adequate file consistency for this to work.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-dependencies\fP
 Print dependency information for the targets on the command line.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-dependencies\fP\fI target\fP
 Print dependency information \fIif\fP
the target is built.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-install\fP
 Install default files OMakefile
and OMakeroot
into the current
directory. You would typically do this to start a project in the current directory.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-install\-all\fP
 In addition to installing files OMakefile
and OMakeroot,
install default OMakefiles
into each subdirectory of the current directory.
\fIcvs\fP(1)
rules are used for filtering the subdirectory list. For example, OMakefiles
are not copied into directories called CVS, RCCS, etc.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-install\-force\fP
 Normally, omake
will prompt before it overwrites any
existing OMakefile\&.
If this option is given, all files are forcibly overwritten
without prompting.
.PP
.TP
\fBvar\-definition\fP
 omake
variables can also be defined on the command
line in the form name=value\&. For example, the CFLAGS variable might be defined
on the command line with the argument CFLAGS="\-Wall \-g"\&.
.PP
In addition, omake
supports a number of debugging flags on the command line. Run
omake \-\-help to get a summary of these flags.
