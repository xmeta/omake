.SH NAME

omake
is a build system designed to scale from small projects to very large projects
spanning many directories. omake
uses a syntax similar to \fImake\fP(1),
with many
additional features, including accurate automated dependency analysis based on MD5 digests.
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
omake
is designed for building projects that might have source files in several directories.
Projects are normally specified using an OMakefile
in each of the project directories, and an
OMakeroot
file in the root directory of the project. The OMakeroot
file specifies
general build rules, and the OMakefiles
specify the build parameters specific to each of the
subdirectories. When omake
runs, it walks the configuration tree, evaluating rules from all
of the OMakefiles.
The project is then built from the entire collection of build rules.
.PP
.SS AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
.PP
Dependency analysis has always been problematic with the \fImake\fP(1)
program. omake
addresses this by adding the \&.SCANNER target, which specifies a command to produce
dependencies. For example, the following rule
.PP
.Vb
    .SCANNER: %.o: %.c
        $(CC) $(INCLUDE) \-MM $<
.Ve
.PP
is the standard way to generate dependencies for \&.c files. omake
will automatically
run the scanner when it needs to determine dependencies for a file.
.PP
.SS CONTENT\-BASED DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
.PP
Dependency analysis in omake uses MD5 digests to determine whether files have changed. After each
run, omake
stores the dependency information in a file called \&.omakedb
in the project
root directory. When a rule is considered for execution, the command is not executed if the target,
dependencies, and command sequence are unchanged since the last run of omake\&.
As an
optimization, omake
does not recompute the digest for a file that has an unchanged
modification time, size, and inode number.
