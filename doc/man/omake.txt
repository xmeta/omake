OMAKE(1)                         Build Tools                          OMAKE(1)



NAME
       omake  is  a build system designed to scale from small projects to very
       large projects spanning many directories. omake uses a  syntax  similar
       to make(1), with many additional features, including accurate automated
       dependency analysis based on MD5 digests.


DESCRIPTION
       omake is designed for building projects that might have source files in
       several  directories.   Projects are normally specified using an OMake-
       file in each of the project directories, and an OMakeroot file  in  the
       root  directory  of  the  project. The OMakeroot file specifies general
       build rules, and the OMakefiles specify the build  parameters  specific
       to each of the subdirectories. When omake runs, it walks the configura-
       tion tree, evaluating rules from all of the OMakefiles.  The project is
       then built from the entire collection of build rules.


   AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
       Dependency  analysis  has always been problematic with the make(1) pro-
       gram. omake addresses this by adding the .SCANNER target, which  speci-
       fies a command to produce dependencies. For example, the following rule

           .SCANNER: %.o: %.c
               $(CC) $(INCLUDE) -MM $<


       is the standard way to generate dependencies for .c files.  omake  will
       automatically  run  the scanner when it needs to determine dependencies
       for a file.


   CONTENT-BASED DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
       Dependency analysis in omake uses  MD5  digests  to  determine  whether
       files  have changed. After each run, omake stores the dependency infor-
       mation in a file called .omakedb in the project root directory. When  a
       rule  is  considered  for execution, the command is not executed if the
       target, dependencies, and command sequence are unchanged since the last
       run  of omake.  As an optimization, omake does not recompute the digest
       for a file that has an unchanged modification  time,  size,  and  inode
       number.

       Guide  For  the user who is already familiar with GNU/BSD make, you may
       wish   to   skip   to   the   more   advanced   examples,    especially
       omake-build-examples,  and  later with omake-language-examples.  If you
       are less familiar with the make model, you may wish to start  with  the
       quickstart omake-quickstart.
