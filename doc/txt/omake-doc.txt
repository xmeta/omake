Chapter 2    OMake quickstart guide
***********************************
    
  

2.1  Description
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  omake is designed for building projects that might have source files
in several directories. Projects are normally specified using an
OMakefile in each of the project directories, and an OMakeroot file in
the root directory of the project. The OMakeroot file specifies general
build rules, and the OMakefiles specify the build parameters specific to
each of the subdirectories. When omake runs, it walks the configuration
tree, evaluating rules from all of the OMakefiles. The project is then
built from the entire collection of build rules.
  

2.1.1  Automatic dependency analysis
====================================
  
  Dependency analysis has always been problematic with the make(1)
program. omake addresses this by adding the `.SCANNER' target, which
specifies a command to produce dependencies. For example, the following
rule
<<
      .SCANNER: %.o: %.c
          $(CC) $(INCLUDE) -MM $<
>>
  
  is the standard way to generate dependencies for `.c' files. omake
will automatically run the scanner when it needs to determine
dependencies for a file.
  

2.1.2  Content-based dependency analysis
========================================
  
  Dependency analysis in omake uses MD5 digests to determine whether
files have changed. After each run, omake stores the dependency
information in a file called .omakedb in the project root directory.
When a rule is considered for execution, the command is not executed if
the target, dependencies, and command sequence are unchanged since the
last run of omake. As an optimization, omake does not recompute the
digest for a file that has an unchanged modification time, size, and
inode number.
  

2.2  For users already familiar with make
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  For users already familiar with the make(1) command, here is a list of
differences to keep in mind when using omake.
  
  
 - In omake, you are much less likely to define build rules of your own.
    The system provides many standard functions (like `StaticCLibrary', 
   described in Section 12.4.3.1 and `CProgram',  described in Section
   12.4.3.5)  to specify these builds more simply. 
 - Implicit rules using `.SUFFIXES' and the `.suf1.suf2:' are not
   supported.  You should use wildcard patterns instead `%.suf2:
   %.suf1'. 
 - Scoping is significant: you should define variables and `.PHONY' 
   targets (see Section 7.12) before they are used. 
 - Subdirectories are incorporated into a project using the  `.SUBDIRS:'
   target (see Section 7.10). 
  
  

2.3  Building a small C program
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  To start a new project, the easiest method is to change directories to
the project root and use the command `omake --install' to install
default OMakefiles.
<<
      $ cd ~/newproject
      $ omake --install
      *** omake: creating OMakeroot
      *** omake: creating OMakefile
      *** omake: project files OMakefile and OMakeroot have been
installed
      *** omake: you should edit these files before continuing
>>
  
  The default OMakefile contains sections for building C and OCaml
programs. For now, we'll build a simple C project.
  Suppose we have a C file called `hello_code.c' containing the
following code:
<<
      #include <stdio.h>
  
      int main(int argc, char **argv)
      {
          printf("Hello world\n");
          return 0;
      }
>>
  
  To build the program a program `hello' from this file, we can use the
`CProgram' function (Section 12.4.3.5). The OMakefile contains just one
line that specifies that the program `hello' is to be built from the
source code in the `hello_code.c' file (note that file suffixes are not
passed to these functions).
<<
      CProgram(hello, hello_code)
>>
  
  Now we can run omake to build the project. Note that the first time we
run omake, it both scans the `hello_code.c' file for dependencies, and
compiles it using the `cc' compiler. The status line printed at the end
indicates how many files were scanned, how many were built, and how many
MD5 digests were computed.
<<
      $ omake hello
      *** omake: reading OMakefiles
      *** omake: finished reading OMakefiles (0.0 sec)
      - scan . hello_code.o
      + cc -I. -MM hello_code.c
      - build . hello_code.o
      + cc -I. -c -o hello_code.o hello_code.c
      - build . hello
      + cc -o hello hello_code.o
      *** omake: done (0.5 sec, 1/6 scans, 2/6 rules, 5/22 digests)
      $ omake
      *** omake: reading OMakefiles
      *** omake: finished reading OMakefiles (0.1 sec)
      *** omake: done (0.1 sec, 0/4 scans, 0/4 rules, 0/9 digests)
>>
  
  If we want to change the compile options, we can redefine the `CC' and
`CFLAGS' variables before the `CProgram' line. In this example, we will
use the `gcc' compiler with the `-g' option. In addition, we will
specify a `.DEFAULT' target to be built by default. The `EXE' variable
is defined to be `.exe' on `Win32' systems; it is empty otherwise.
<<
      CC = gcc
      CFLAGS += -g
      CProgram(hello, hello_code)
      .DEFAULT: hello$(EXE)
>>
  
  Here is the corresponding run for omake.
<<
      $ omake
      *** omake: reading OMakefiles
      *** omake: finished reading OMakefiles (0.0 sec)
      - scan . hello_code.o
      + gcc -g -I. -MM hello_code.c
      - build . hello_code.o
      + gcc -g -I. -c -o hello_code.o hello_code.c
      - build . hello
      + gcc -g -o hello hello_code.o
      *** omake: done (0.4 sec, 1/7 scans, 2/7 rules, 3/22 digests)
>>
  
  We can, of course, include multiple files in the program. Suppose we
write a new file `hello_helper.c'. We would include this in the project
as follows.
<<
      CC = gcc
      CFLAGS += -g
      CProgram(hello, hello_code hello_helper)
      .DEFAULT: hello$(EXE)
>>
  
  

2.4  Larger projects
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  As the project grows it is likely that we will want to build libraries
of code. Libraries can be built using the `StaticCLibrary' function.
Here is an example of an OMakefile with two libraries.
<<
      CC = gcc
      CFLAGS += -g
  
      FOO_FILES = foo_a foo_b
      BAR_FILES = bar_a bar_b bar_c
  
      StaticCLibrary(libfoo, $(FOO_FILES))
      StaticCLibrary(libbar, $(BAR_FILES))
  
      # The hello program is linked with both libraries
      LIBS = libfoo libbar
      CProgram(hello, hello_code hello_helper)
  
      .DEFAULT: hello$(EXE)
>>
  
  

2.5  Subdirectories
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  As the project grows even further, it is a good idea to split it into
several directories. Suppose we place the `libfoo' and `libbar' into
subdirectories.
  In each subdirectory, we define an OMakefile for that directory. For
example, here is an example OMakefile for the `foo' subdirectory.
<<
      INCLUDES += .. ../bar
  
      FOO_FILES = foo_a foo_b
      StaticCLibrary(libfoo, $(FOO_FILES))
>>
  
  Note the the `INCLUDES' variable is defined to include the other
directories in the project.
  Now, the next step is to link the subdirectories into the main
project. The project OMakefile should be modified to include a
`.SUBDIRS:' target.
<<
      # Project configuration
      CC = gcc
      CFLAGS += -g
  
      # Subdirectories
      .SUBDIRS: foo bar
  
      # The libraries are now in subdirectories
      LIBS = foo/libfoo bar/libbar
  
      CProgram(hello, hello_code hello_helper)
  
      .DEFAULT: hello$(EXE)
>>
  
  Note that the variables `CC' and `CFLAGS' are defined before the
`.SUBDIRS' target. These variables remain defined in the subdirectories,
so that `libfoo' and `libbar' use `gcc -g'.
  If the two directories are to be configured differently, we have two
choices. The OMakefile in each subdirectory can be modified with its
configuration (this is how it would normally be done). Alternatively, we
can also place the change in the root OMakefile.
<<
      # Default project configuration
      CC = gcc
      CFLAGS += -g
  
      # libfoo uses the default configuration
      .SUBDIRS: foo
  
      # libbar uses the optimizing compiler
      CFLAGS += -O3
      .SUBDIRS: bar
  
      # Main program
      LIBS = foo/libfoo bar/libbar
      CProgram(hello, hello_code hello_helper)
  
      .DEFAULT: hello$(EXE)
>>
  
  Note that the way we have specified it, the `CFLAGS' variable also
contains the `-O3' option for the `CProgram', and `hello_code.c' and
`hello_helper.c' file will both be compiled with the `-O3' option. If we
want to make the change truly local to `libbar', we can put the `bar'
subdirectory in its own scope using the `section' form.
<<
      # Default project configuration
      CC = gcc
      CFLAGS += -g
  
      # libfoo uses the default configuration
      .SUBDIRS: foo
  
      # libbar uses the optimizing compiler

          CFLAGS += -O3
          .SUBDIRS: bar
  
      # Main program does not use the optimizing compiler
      LIBS = foo/libfoo bar/libbar
      CProgram(hello, hello_code hello_helper)
  
      .DEFAULT: hello$(EXE)
>>
  
  Later, suppose we decide to port this project to `Win32', and we
discover that we need different compiler flags and an additional
library.
<<
      # Default project configuration
      if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
          CC = cl /nologo
          CFLAGS += /DWIN32 /MT
          export
      else
          CC = gcc
          CFLAGS += -g
          export
  
      # libfoo uses the default configuration
      .SUBDIRS: foo
  
      # libbar uses the optimizing compiler
      section
          CFLAGS += $(if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32), $(EMPTY), -O3)
          .SUBDIRS: bar
  
      # Default libraries
      LIBS = foo/libfoo bar/libbar
  
      # We need libwin32 only on Win32
      if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
         LIBS += win32/libwin32
  
         .SUBDIRS: win32
         export
  
      # Main program does not use the optimizing compiler
      CProgram(hello, hello_code hello_helper)
  
      .DEFAULT: hello$(EXE)
>>
  
  Note the use of the `export' directives to export the variable
definitions from the if-statements. Variables in omake are
scoped---variables in nested blocks (blocks with greater indentation),
are not normally defined in outer blocks. The `export' directive
specifies that the variable definitions in the nested blocks should be
exported to their parent block.
  Finally, for this example, we decide to copy all libraries into a
common `lib' directory. We first define a directory variable, and
replace occurrences of the `lib' string with the variable.
<<
      # The common lib directory
      LIB = $(dir lib)
  
      # phony target to build just the libraries
      .PHONY: makelibs
  
      # Default project configuration
      if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
          CC = cl /nologo
          CFLAGS += /DWIN32 /MT
          export
      else
          CC = gcc
          CFLAGS += -g
          export
  
      # libfoo uses the default configuration
      .SUBDIRS: foo
  
      # libbar uses the optimizing compiler
      section
          CFLAGS += $(if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32), $(EMPTY), -O3)
          .SUBDIRS: bar
  
      # Default libraries
      LIBS = $(LIB)/libfoo $(LIB)/libbar
  
      # We need libwin32 only on Win32
      if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
         LIBS += $(LIB)/libwin32
  
         .SUBDIRS: win32
         export
  
      # Main program does not use the optimizing compiler
      CProgram(hello, hello_code hello_helper)
  
      .DEFAULT: hello$(EXE)
>>
  
  In each subdirectory, we modify the OMakefiles in the library
directories to install them into the `$(LIB)' directory. Here is the
relevant change to foo/OMakefile.
<<
      INCLUDES += .. ../bar
  
      FOO_FILES = foo_a foo_b
      StaticCLibraryInstall(makelib, $(LIB), libfoo, $(FOO_FILES))
>>
  
  Directory (and file names) evaluate to relative pathnames. Within the
`foo' directory, the `$(LIB)' variable evaluates to `../lib'.
  As another example, instead of defining the `INCLUDES' variable
separately in each subdirectory, we can define it in the toplevel as
follows.
<<
      INCLUDES = $(ROOT) $(dir foo bar win32)
>>
  
  In the `foo' directory, the `INCLUDES' variable will evaluate to the
string `.. . ../bar ../win32'. In the `bar' directory, it would be `..
../foo . ../win32'. In the root directory it would be `. foo bar win32'.
  

2.6  Other things to consider
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  omake also handles recursive subdirectories. For example, suppose the
`foo' directory itself contains several subdirectories. The
foo/OMakefile would then contain its own `.SUBDIRS' target, and each of
its subdirectories would contain its own `OMakefile'.
  

2.7  Building OCaml programs
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  By default, omake is also configured with functions for building OCaml
programs. The functions for OCaml program use the `OCaml' prefix. For
example, suppose we reconstruct the previous example in OCaml, and we
have a file called `hello_code.ml' that contains the following code.
<<
     open Printf
  
     let () = printf "Hello world\n"
>>
  
  An example OMakefile for this simple project would contain the
following.
<<
      # Use the byte-code compiler
      BYTE_ENABLED = true
      NATIVE_ENABLED = false
      OCAMLCFLAGS += -g
  
      # Build the program
      OCamlProgram(hello, hello_code)
      .DEFAULT: hello.run
>>
  
  Next, suppose the we have two library subdirectories: the `foo'
subdirectory is written in C, the `bar' directory is written in OCaml,
and we need to use the standard OCaml `Unix' module.
<<
      # Default project configuration
      if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
          CC = cl /nologo
          CFLAGS += /DWIN32 /MT
          export
      else
          CC = gcc
          CFLAGS += -g
          export
  
      # Use the byte-code compiler
      BYTE_ENABLED = true
      NATIVE_ENABLED = false
      OCAMLCFLAGS += -g
  
      # library subdirectories
      INCLUDES += $(dir foo bar)
      OCAMLINCLUDES += $(dir foo bar)
      .SUBDIRS: foo bar
  
      # C libraries
      LIBS = foo/libfoo
  
      # OCaml libraries
      OCAML_LIBS = bar/libbar
  
      # Also use the Unix module
      OCAML_OTHER_LIBS = unix
  
      # The main program
      OCamlProgram(hello, hello_code hello_helper)
  
      .DEFAULT: hello
>>
  
  The foo/OMakefile would be configured as a C library.
<<
      FOO_FILES = foo_a foo_b
      StaticCLibrary(libfoo, $(FOO_FILES))
>>
  
  The bar/OMakefile would build an ML library.
<<
     BAR_FILES = bar_a bar_b bar_c
     OCamlLibrary(libbar, $(BAR_FILES))
>>
  
  

2.8  The OMakefile and OMakeroot files
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

     
  OMake uses the OMakefile and OMakeroot files for configuring a
project. The syntax of these files is the same, but their role is
slightly different. For one thing, every project must have exactly one
OMakeroot file in the project root directory. This file serves to
identify the project root, and it contains code that sets up the
project. In contrast, a multi-directory project will often have an
OMakefile in each of the project subdirectories, specifying how to build
the files in that subdirectory.
  Normally, the OMakeroot file is boilerplate. The following listing is
a typical example.
<<
      include $(STDLIB)/build/Common
      include $(STDLIB)/build/C
      include $(STDLIB)/build/OCaml
      include $(STDLIB)/build/LaTeX
  
      # Redefine the command-line variables
      DefineCommandVars(.)
  
      # The current directory is part of the project
      .SUBDIRS: .
>>
  
  The `include' lines include the standard configuration files needed
for the project. The `$(STDLIB)' represents the omake library directory.
The only required configuration file is `Common'. The others are
optional; for example, the `$(STDLIB)/build/OCaml' file is needed only
when the project contains programs written in OCaml.
  The `DefineCommandVars' function defines any variables specified on
the command line (as arguments of the form `VAR=<value>'). The
`.SUBDIRS' line specifies that the current directory is part of the
project (so the `OMakefile' should be read).
  Normally, the `OMakeroot' file should be small and
project-independent. Any project-specific configuration should be placed
in the `OMakefiles' of the project.
  

2.9  Multiple version support
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  OMake version `0.9.6' introduced preliminary support for multiple,
simultaneous versions of a project. Versioning uses the `vmount(dir1,
dir2)' function, which defines a ``virtual mount'' of directory `dir1'
over directory `dir2'. A ``virtual mount'' is like a transparent mount
in Unix, where the files from `dir1' appear in the `dir2' namespace, but
new files are created in `dir2'. More precisely, the filename `dir2/foo'
refers to: a) the file `dir1/foo' if it exists, or b) `dir2/foo'
otherwise.
  The `vmount' function makes it easy to specify multiple versions of a
project. Suppose we have a project where the source files are in the
directory `src/', and we want to compile two versions, one with
debugging support and one optimized. We create two directories, debug
and opt, and mount the src directory over them.
<<
      section
          CFLAGS += -g
          vmount(-l, src, debug)
          .SUBDIRS: debug
  
      section
          CFLAGS += -O3
          vmount(-l, src, opt)
          .SUBDIRS: opt
>>
  
  Here, we are using `section' blocks to define the scope of the
`vmount'---you may not need them in your project.
  The `-l' option is optional. It specifies that files form the `src'
directory should be linked into the target directories (or copied, if
the system is Win32). The links are added as files are referenced. If no
options are given, then files are not copied or linked, but filenames
are translated to refer directly to the `src/' files.
  Now, when a file is referenced in the `debug' directory, it is linked
from the `src' directory if it exists. For example, when the file
`debug/OMakefile' is read, the `src/OMakefile' is linked into the
`debug/' directory.
  The `vmount' model is fairly transparent. The `OMakefile's can be
written as if referring to files in the `src/' directory---they need not
be aware of mounting. However, there are a few points to keep in mind.
  

2.10  Notes
*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  
  
 - When using the `vmount' function for versioning, it wise to keep the
   source files distinct from the compiled versions. For example,
   suppose the source directory contained a file `src/foo.o'. When
   mounted, the `foo.o' file will be the same in all versions, which is
   probably not what you want. It is better to keep the `src/' directory
   pristine, containing no compiled code.
 
 - When using the `vmount -l' option, files are linked into the version
   directory only if they are referenced in the project. Functions that
   examine the filesystem (like `$(ls ...)') may produce unexpected
   results. 
  


Chapter 3    Additional build examples
**************************************
     
  Let's explain the OMake build model a bit more. One issue that
dominates this discussion is that OMake is based on global project
analysis. That means you define a configuration for the entire project,
and you run one instance of omake.
  For single-directory projects this doesn't mean much. For
multi-directory projects it means a lot. With GNU make, you would
usually invoke the `make' program recursively for each directory in the
project. For example, suppose you had a project with some project root
directory, containing a directory of sources `src', which in turn
contains subdirectories `lib' and `main'. So your project looks like
this nice piece of ASCII art.
<<
      my_project/
      |--> Makefile
      `--> src/
           |---> Makefile
           |---> lib/
           |     |---> Makefile
           |     `---> source files...
           `---> main/
                 |---> Makefile
                 `---> source files...
>>
  Typically, with GNU make, you would start an instance of `make' in
`my_project/'; this would in term start an instance of `make' in the
`src/' directory; and this would start new instances in `lib/' and
`main/'. Basically, you count up the number of `Makefile's in the
project, and that is the number of instances of `make' processes that
will be created.
  The number of processes is no big deal with today's machines
(sometimes contrary the the author's opinion, we no longer live in the
1970s). The problem with the scheme was that each `make' process had a
separate configuration, and it took a lot of work to make sure that
everything was consistent. Furthermore, suppose the programmer runs
`make' in the `main/' directory, but the `lib/' is out-of-date. In this
case, `make' would happily crank away, perhaps trying to rebuild files
in `lib/', perhaps just giving up.
  With OMake this changes entirely. Well, not entirely. The source
structure is quite similar, we merely add some Os to the ASCII art.
<<
      my_project/
      |--> OMakeroot   (or Root.om)
      |--> OMakefile
      `--> src/
           |---> OMakefile
           |---> lib/
           |     |---> OMakefile
           |     `---> source files...
           `---> main/
                 |---> OMakefile
                 `---> source files...
>>
  
    The role of each `<dir>/OMakefile' plays the same role as each
`<dir>/Makefile': it describes how to build the source files in `<dir>'.
The OMakefile retains much of syntax and structure of the Makefile, but
in most cases it is much simpler.
  One minor difference is the presence of the OMakeroot in the project
root. The main purpose of this file is to indicate where the project
root is in the first place (in case `omake' is invoked from a
subdirectory). The `OMakeroot' serves as the bootstrap file; omake
starts by reading this file first. Otherwise, the syntax and evaluation
of `OMakeroot' is no different from any other `OMakefile'.
  The big difference is that OMake performs a global analysis. Here is
what happens when `omake' starts.
   
  
 1. omake locates that OMakeroot file, and reads it. 
 2. Each OMakefile points to its subdirectory OMakefiles using the
   .SUBDIRS target. For example, `my_project/OMakefile' has a rule,
   <<
         .SUBDIRS: src
   >>
 
 and the `my_project/src/OMakefile' has a rule,
   <<
         .SUBDIRS: lib main
   >>
 
 `omake' uses these rules to read and evaluate every `OMakefile' in the
   project. Reading and evaluation is fast. This part of the process is
   cheap.
 
 3. Now that the entire configuration is read, `omake' determines which
   files are out-of-date (using a global analysis), and starts the build
   process. This may take a while, depending on what exactly needs to be
   done. 
  
  There are several advantages to this model. First, since analysis is
global, it is much easier to ensure that the build configuration is
consistent--after all, there is only one configuration. Another benefit
is that the build configuration is inherited, and can be re-used, down
the hierarchy. Typically, the root `OMakefile' defines some standard
boilerplate and configuration, and this is inherited by subdirectories
that tweak and modify it (but do not need to restate it entirely). The
disadvantage of course is space, since this is global analysis after
all. In practice rarely seems to be a concern; omake takes up much less
space than your web browser even on large projects.
  Some notes to the GNU/BSD make user. 
  
 - OMakefiles are a lot like Makefiles. The syntax is similar, and there
   many of the builtin functions are similar. However, the two build
   systems are not the same. Some evil features (in the authors'
   opinions) have been dropped in OMake, and some new features have been
   added.
 
 - OMake works the same way on all platforms, including Win32. The
   standard configuration does the right thing, but if you care about
   porting your code to multiple platforms, and you use some tricky
   features, you may need to condition parts of your build config on the
   `$(OSTYPE)' variable.
 
 - A minor issue is that OMake dependency analysis is based on MD5 file
   digests. That is, dependencies are based on file contents, not file
   modification times. Say goodbye to false rebuilds based on spurius
   timestamp changes and mismatches between local time and fileserver
   time. 
  
  

3.1  OMakeroot vs. OMakefile
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Before we begin with examples, let's ask the first question, ``What is
the difference between the project root OMakeroot and OMakefile?'' A
short answer is, there is no difference, but you must have an OMakeroot
file (or Root.om file).
  However, the normal style is that OMakeroot is boilerplate and is
more-or-less the same for all projects. The OMakefile is where you put
all your project-specific stuff.
  To get started, you don't have to do this yourself. In most cases you
just perform the following step in your project root directory.
  
  
 - Run `omake --install' in your project root. 
  
  This will create the initial OMakeroot and OMakefile files that you
can edit to get started.
  

3.2  An example C project
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  To begin, let's start with a simple example. Let's say that we have a
full directory tree, containing the following files.
<<
      my_project/
      |--> OMakeroot
      |--> OMakefile
      `--> src/
           |---> OMakefile
           |---> lib/
           |     |---> OMakefile
           |     |---> ouch.c
           |     |---> ouch.h
           |     `---> bandaid.c
           `---> main/
                 |---> OMakefile
                 |---> horsefly.c
                 |---> horsefly.h
                 `---> main.c
>>
  
  Here is an example listing.
<<
  my_project/OMakeroot:
      # Include the standard configuration for C applications
      open build/C
      
      # Process the command-line vars
      DefineCommandVars()
      
      # Include the OMakefile in this directory.
      .SUBDIRS: .
  
  my_project/OMakefile:
      # Set up the standard configuration
      CFLAGS += -g
  
      # Include the src subdirectory
      .SUBDIRS: src
  
  my_project/src/OMakefile:
      # Add any extra options you like
      CFLAGS += -O2
  
      # Include the subdirectories
      .SUBDIRS: lib main
  
  my_project/src/lib/OMakefile:
      # Build the library as a static library.
      # This builds libbug.a on Unix/OSX, or libbug.lib on Win32.
      # Note that the source files are listed _without_ suffix.
      StaticCLibrary(libbug, ouch bandaid)
  
  my_project/src/main/OMakefile:
      # Some files include the .h files in ../lib
      INCLUDES += ../lib
  
      # Indicate which libraries we want to link against.
      LIBS[] +=
          ../lib/libbug
  
      # Build the program.
      # Builds horsefly.exe on Win32, and horsefly on Unix.
      # The first argument is the name of the executable.
      # The second argument is an array of object files (without suffix)
      # that are part of the program.
      CProgram(horsefly, horsefly main)
  
      # Build the program by default (in case omake is called
      # without any arguments).  EXE is defined as .exe on Win32,
      # otherwise it is empty.
      .DEFAULT: horsefly$(EXE)
>>
  
  Most of the configuration here is defined in the file `build/C.om'
(which is part of the OMake distribution). This file takes care of a lot
of work, including: 
  
 - Defining the `StaticCLibrary' and `CProgram' functions, which
   describe the canonical way to build C libraries and programs. 
 - Defining a mechanism for scanning each of the source programs to
   discover dependencies. That is, it defines .SCANNER rules for C
   source files. 
  
  Variables are inherited down the hierarchy, so for example, the value
of CFLAGS in src/main/OMakefile is ```-g -O2'''.
  

3.3  An example OCaml project
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Let's repeat the example, assuming we are using OCaml instead of C.
This time, the directory tree looks like this.
<<
      my_project/
      |--> OMakeroot
      |--> OMakefile
      `--> src/
           |---> OMakefile
           |---> lib/
           |     |---> OMakefile
           |     |---> ouch.ml
           |     |---> ouch.mli
           |     `---> bandaid.ml
           `---> main/
                 |---> OMakefile
                 |---> horsefly.ml
                 |---> horsefly.mli
                 `---> main.ml
>>
  
  The listing is only a bit different.
<<
  my_project/OMakeroot:
      # Include the standard configuration for OCaml applications
      open build/OCaml
      
      # Process the command-line vars
      DefineCommandVars()
      
      # Include the OMakefile in this directory.
      .SUBDIRS: .
  
  my_project/OMakefile:
      # Set up the standard configuration
      OCAMLFLAGS += -Wa
  
      # Do we want to use the bytecode compiler,
      # or the native-code one?  Let's use both for
      # this example.
      NATIVE_ENABLED = true
      BYTE_ENABLED = true
  
      # Include the src subdirectory
      .SUBDIRS: src
  
  my_project/src/OMakefile:
      # Include the subdirectories
      .SUBDIRS: lib main
  
  my_project/src/lib/OMakefile:
      # Let's do aggressive inlining on native code
      OCAMLOPTFLAGS += -inline 10
  
      # Build the library as a static library.
      # This builds libbug.a on Unix/OSX, or libbug.lib on Win32.
      # Note that the source files are listed _without_ suffix.
      OCamlLibrary(libbug, ouch bandaid)
  
  my_project/src/main/OMakefile:
      # These files depend on the interfaces in ../lib
      OCAMLINCLUDES += ../lib
  
      # Indicate which libraries we want to link against.
      OCAML_LIBS[] +=
          ../lib/libbug
  
      # Build the program.
      # Builds horsefly.exe on Win32, and horsefly on Unix.
      # The first argument is the name of the executable.
      # The second argument is an array of object files (without suffix)
      # that are part of the program.
      OCamlProgram(horsefly, horsefly main)
  
      # Build the program by default (in case omake is called
      # without any arguments).  EXE is defined as .exe on Win32,
      # otherwise it is empty.
      .DEFAULT: horsefly$(EXE)
>>
  
  In this case, most of the configuration here is defined in the file
`build/OCaml.om'. In this particular configuration, files in
`my_project/src/lib' are compiled aggressively with the option `-inline
10', but files in `my_project/src/lib' are compiled normally.
  

3.4  Handling new languages
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  The previous two examples seem to be easy enough, but they rely on the
OMake standard library (the files `build/C' and `build/OCaml') to do all
the work. What happens if we want to write a build configuration for a
language that is not already supported in the OMake standard library?
  For this example, let's suppose we are adopting a new language. The
language uses the standard compile/link model, but is not in the OMake
standard library. Specifically, let's say we have the following setup.
  
  
 - Source files are defined in files with a `.cat' suffix (for
   Categorical Abstract Terminology). 
 - `.cat' files are compiled with the `catc' compiler to produce `.woof'
   files (Wicked Object-Oriented Format). 
 - `.woof' files are linked by the `catc' compiler with the `-c' option
   to produce a `.dog' executable (Digital Object Group). The `catc'
   also defines a `-a' option to combine several `.woof' files into a
   library. 
 - Each `.cat' can refer to other source files. If a source file `a.cat'
   contains a line `open b', then `a.cat' depends on the file `b.woof',
   and `a.cat' must be recompiled if `b.woof' changes. The `catc'
   function takes a `-I' option to define a search path for
   dependencies. 
  
  To define a build configuration, we have to do three things. 
  
 1. Define a `.SCANNER' rule for discovering dependency information for
   the source files. 
 2. Define a generic rule for compiling a `.cat' file to a `.woof' file.
   
 3. Define a rule (as a function) for linking `.woof' files to produce a
   `.dog' executable. 
  
  Initially, these definitions will be placed in the project root
`OMakefile'.
  

3.4.1  Defining a default compilation rule
==========================================
  
  Let's start with part 2, defining a generic compilation rule. We'll
define the build rule as an implicit rule. To handle the include path,
we'll define a variable `CAT_INCLUDES' that specifies the include path.
This will be an array of directories. To define the options, we'll use a
lazy variable (Section 6.5). In case there are any other standard flags,
we'll define a `CAT_FLAGS' variable.
<<
     # Define the catc command, in case we ever want to override it
     CATC = catc
  
     # The default flags are empty
     CAT_FLAGS =
     
     # The directories in the include path (empty by default)
     INCLUDES[] =
  
     # Compute the include options from the include path
     PREFIXED_INCLUDES[] = $`(mapprefix -I, $(INCLUDES))
  
     # The default way to build a .woof file
     %.woof: %.cat
         $(CATC) $(PREFIXED_INCLUDES) $(CAT_FLAGS) -c $<
>>
  
  The final part is the build rule itself, where we call the `catc'
compiler with the include path, and the `CAT_FLAGS' that have been
defined. The `$<' variable represents the source file.
  

3.4.2  Defining a rule for linking
==================================
  
  For linking, we'll define another rule describing how to perform
linking. Instead of defining an implicit rule, we'll define a function
that describes the linking step. The function will take two arguments;
the first is the name of the executable (without suffix), and the second
is the files to link (also without suffixes). Here is the code fragment.
<<
      # Optional link options
      CAT_LINK_FLAGS =
  
      # The function that defines how to build a .dog program
      CatProgram(program, files) =
          # Add the suffixes
          file_names = $(addsuffix .woof, $(files))
          prog_name = $(addsuffix .dog, $(files))
  
          # The build rule
          $(prog_name): $(file_names)
              $(CATC) $(PREFIXED_INCLUDES) $(CAT_FLAGS)
$(CAT_LINK_FLAGS) -o $@ $+
  
          # Return the program name
          value $(prog_name)
>>
  
  The `CAT_LINK_FLAGS' variable is defined just in case we want to pass
additional flags specific to the link step. Now that this function is
defined, whenever we want to define a rule for building a program, we
simply call the rule. The previous implicit rule specifies how to
compile each source file, and the `CatProgram' function specifies how to
build the executable.
<<
      # Build a rover.dog program from the source
      # files neko.cat and chat.cat.
      # Compile it by default.
      .DEFAULT: $(CatProgram rover, neko chat)
>>
  
  

3.4.3  Dependency scanning
==========================
   
  That's it, almost. The part we left out was automated dependency
scanning. This is one of the nicer features of OMake, and one that makes
build specifications easier to write and more robust. Strictly speaking,
it isn't required, but you definitely want to do it.
  The mechanism is to define a `.SCANNER' rule, which is like a normal
rule, but it specifies how to compute dependencies, not the target
itself. In this case, we want to define a `.SCANNER' rule of the
following form.
<<
      .SCANNER: %.woof: %.cat
          <commands>
>>
  
  This rule specifies that a `.woof' file may have additional
dependencies that can be extracted from the corresponding `.cat' file by
executing the `<commands>'. The result of executing the `<commands>'
should be a sequence of dependencies in OMake format, printed to the
standard output.
  As we mentioned, each `.cat' file specifies dependencies on `.woof'
files with an `open' directive. For example, if the `neko.cat' file
contains a line `open chat', then `neko.woof' depends on `chat.woof'. In
this case, the `<commands>' should print the following line.
<<
      neko.woof: chat.woof
>>
  
  For an analogy that might make this clearer, consider the C
programming language, where a `.o' file is produced by compiling a `.c'
file. If a file `foo.c' contains a line like `#include "fum.h"', then
`foo.c' should be recompiled whenever `fum.h' changes. That is, the file
`foo.o' depends on the file `fum.h'. In the OMake parlance, this is
called an implicit dependency, and the `.SCANNER' `<commands>' would
print a line like the following.
<<
      foo.o: fum.h
>>
  
   Now, returning to the animal world, to compute the dependencies of
`neko.woof', we should scan `neko.cat', line-by-line, looking for lines
of the form `open <name>'. We could do this by writing a program, but it
is easy enough to do it in `omake' itself. We can use the builtin `awk'
function (Section 9.11.5) to scan the source file. One slight
complication is that the dependencies depend on the `INCLUDE' path.
We'll use the `find-in-path' function (Section 9.2.6) to find them. Here
we go.
<<
      .SCANNER: %.woof: %.cat
          section
              # Scan the file
              deps[] =
              awk($<)
              case $'^open'
                  deps[] += $2
                  export
  
              # Remove duplicates, and find the files in the include
path
              deps = $(find-in-path $(INCLUDES), $(set $(deps)))
  
              # Print the dependencies
              println($"$@: $(deps)")
>>
  
  Let's look at the parts. First, the entire body is defined in a
`section' because we are computing it internally, not as a sequence of
shell commands.
  We use the `deps' variable to collect all the dependencies. The `awk'
function scans the source file (`$<') line-by-line. For lines that match
the regular expression `^open' (meaning that the line begins with the
word `open'), we add the second word on the line to the `deps' variable.
For example, if the input line is `open chat', then we would add the
`chat' string to the `deps' array. All other lines in the source file
are ignored.
  Next, the `$(set $(deps))' expression removes any duplicate values in
the `deps' array (sorting the array alphabetically in the process). The
`find-in-path' function then finds the actual location of each file in
the include path.
  The final step is print the result as the string `$"$@: $(deps)"' The
quotations are added to flatten the `deps' array to a simple string.
  

3.4.4  Pulling it all together
==============================
  
  To complete the example, let's pull it all together into a single
project, much like our previous example.
<<
      my_project/
      |--> OMakeroot
      |--> OMakefile
      `--> src/
           |---> OMakefile
           |---> lib/
           |     |---> OMakefile
           |     |---> neko.cat
           |     `---> chat.cat
           `---> main/
                 |---> OMakefile
                 `---> main.cat
>>
  
  The listing for the entire project is as follows. Here, we also
include a function `CatLibrary' to link several `.woof' files into a
library.

  Some notes. The confuration in the project OMekeroot defines the
standard configuration, including the dependency scanner, the default
rule for compiling source files, and functions for building libraries
and programs.
  These rules and functions are inherited by subdirectories, so the
`.SCANNER' and build rules are used automatically in each subdirectory,
so you don't need to repeat them.
  

3.4.5  Finishing up
===================
  
  At this point we are done, but there are a few things we can consider.
  First, the rules for building cat programs is defined in the project
`OMakefile'. If you had another cat project somewhere, you would need to
copy the `OMakeroot' (and modify it as needed). Instead of that, you
should consider moving the configuration to a shared library directory,
in a file like `Cat.om'. That way, instead of copying the code, you
could include the shared copy with an OMAke command `open Cat'. The
share ddirectory should be added to your `OMAKEPATH' environment
variable to ensure that `omake' knows how to find it.
  Better yet, if you are happy with your work, consider submitting it as
a standard configuration (by sending a request to `omake@metaprl.org')
so that others can make use of it too.
  

3.5  Collapsing the hierarchy, .SUBDIRS bodies
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  Some projects have many subdirectories that all have the same
configuration. For instance, suppose you have a project with many
subdirectories, each containing a set of images that are to be composed
into a web page. Apart from the specific images, the configuration of
each file is the same.
  To make this more concrete, suppose the project hase four
subdirectories `page1', `page2', `page3', and `page4'. Each contains two
files `image1.jpg' and `image2.jpg' that are part of a web page
generated by a program `genhtml'.
  Instead of of defining a `OMakefile' in each directory, we can define
it as a body to the `.SUBDIRS' command.
<<
      .SUBDIRS: page1 page2 page3 page4
          index.html: image1.jpg image2jpg
              genhtml $+ > $@
>>
  
  The body of the `.SUBDIRS' is interpreted exactly as if it were the
`OMakefile', and it can contain any of the normal statements. The body
is evaluated in the subdirectory for each of the subdirectories. We can
see this if we add a statement that prints the current directory
(`$(CWD)').
<<
      .SUBDIRS: page1 page2 page3 page4
          println($(absname $(CWD)))
          index.html: image1.jpg image2jpg
              genhtml $+ > $@
    # prints
      /home/jyh/.../page1
      /home/jyh/.../page2
      /home/jyh/.../page3
      /home/jyh/.../page4
>>
  
  

3.5.1  Using glob patterns
==========================
  
  Of course, this specification is quite rigid. In practice, it is
likely that each subdirectory will have a different set of images, and
all should be included in the web page. One of the easier solutions is
to use one of the directory-listing functions, like `glob' (Section
9.4.1) or `ls' (Section 9.4.2). The `glob' function takes a shell
pattern, and returns an array of file with matching filenames in the
current directory.
<<
      .SUBDIRS: page1 page2 page3 page4
          IMAGES = $(glob *.jpg)
          index.html: $(IMAGES)
              genhtml $+ > $@
>>
  
  

3.5.2  Simplified sub-configurations
====================================
  
  Another option is to add a configuration file in each of the
subdirectories that defines directory-specific information. For this
example, we might define a file `BuildInfo.om' in each of the
subdirectories that defines a list of images in that directory. The
`.SUBDIRS' line is similar, but we include the BuildInfo file.
<<
      .SUBDIRS: page1 page2 page3 page4
          include BuildInfo   # Defines the IMAGES variable
  
          index.html: $(IMAGES)
              genhtml $+ > $@
>>
  
  Where we might have the following configurations.
<<
     page1/BuildInfo.om:
         IMAGES[] = image.jpg
     page2/BuildInfo.om:
         IMAGES[] = ../common/header.jpg winlogo.jpg
     page3/BuildInfo.om:
         IMAGES[] = ../common/header.jpg unixlogo.jpg daemon.jpg
     page4/BuildInfo.om:
         IMAGES[] = fee.jpg fi.jpg foo.jpg fum.jpg
>>
  
  

3.5.3  Computing the subdirectory list
======================================
  
  The other hardcoded specification is the list of subdirectories
`page1', ..., `page4'. Rather than editing the project `OMakefile' each
time a directory is added, we could compute it (again with `glob').
<<
      .SUBDIRS: $(glob page*)
          index.html: $(glob *.jpg)
              genhtml $+ > $@
>>
  
  Alternately, the directory structure may be hierarchical. Instead of
using `glob', we could use the `subdirs' function, returns each of the
directories in a hierarchy. For example, this is the result of
evaluating the `subdirs' function in the omake project root. The `P'
option, passed as the first argument, specifies that the listing is
``proper,'' it should not include the `omake' directory itself.
<<
      osh> subdirs(P, .)
      - : <array
              /home/jyh/.../omake/mk : Dir
              /home/jyh/.../omake/RPM : Dir
              ...
              /home/jyh/.../omake/osx_resources : Dir>
>>
  
  Using `subdirs', our example is now as follows.
<<
      .SUBDIRS: $(subdirs P, .)
          index.html: $(glob *.jpg)
              genhtml $+ > $@
>>
  
  In this case, every subdirectory will be included in the project.
  If we are using the `BuildInfo.om' option. Instead of including every
subdirectory, we could include only those that contain a `BuildInfo.om'
file. For this purpose, we can use the `find' function, which traverses
the directory hierarchy looking for files that match a test expression.
In our case, we want to search for files with the name `BuildInfo.om'.
Here is an example call.
<<
      osh> FILES = $(find . -name BuildInfo.om)
      - : <array
              /home/jyh/.../omake/doc/html/BuildInfo.om : File
              /home/jyh/.../omake/src/BuildInfo.om : File
              /home/jyh/.../omake/tests/simple/BuildInfo.om : File>
      osh> DIRS = $(dirof $(FILES))
      - : <array
              /home/jyh/.../omake/doc/html : Dir
              /home/jyh/.../omake/src : Dir
              /home/jyh/.../omake/tests/simple : Dir>
>>
  
  In this example, there are three `BuildInfo.om' files, in the
`doc/html', `src', and `tests/simple' directories. The `dirof' function
returns the directories for each of the files.
  Returning to our original example, we modify it as follows.
<<
      .SUBDIRS: $(dirof $(find . -name BuildInfo.om))
          include BuildInfo   # Defines the IMAGES variable
  
          index.html: $(IMAGES)
              genhtml $+ > $@
>>
  
  

3.5.4  Temporary directories
============================
  
  Sometimes, your project may include temporary directories--directories
where you place intermediate results. these deirectories are deleted
whenever the project is cleanup up. This means, in particular, that you
can't place an `OMakefile' in a temporary directory, because it will be
removed when the directory is removed.
  Instead, if you need to define a configuration for any of these
directories, you will need to define it using a `.SUBDIRS' body.
<<
      section
          CREATE_SUBDIRS = true
  
          .SUBDIRS: tmp
              # Compute an MD5 digest
              %.digest: %.comments
                 echo $(digest $<) > $@
  
              # Extract comments from the source files
              %.comments: ../src/%.src
                 grep '^#' $< > $@
  
              .DEFAULT: foo.digest
  
      .PHONY: clean
  
      clean:
          rm -rf tmp        
>>
  
  In this example, we define the `CREATE_SUBDIRS' variable as true, so
that the `tmp' directory will be created if it does not exist. The
`.SUBDIRS' body in this example is a bit contrived, but it illustrates
the kind of specification you might expect. The `clean' phony-target
indicates that the `tmp' directory should be removed when the project is
cleaned up.


Chapter 4    OMake concepts and syntax
**************************************
    
  Projects are specified to omake with OMakefiles. The OMakefile has a
format similar to a Makefile. An OMakefile has three main kinds of
syntactic objects: variable definitions, function definitions, and rule
definitions.
  

4.1  Variables
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  Variables are defined with the following syntax. The name is any
sequence of alphanumeric characters, underscore `_', and hyphen `-'.
<<
     <name> = <value>
>>
  
  Values are defined as a sequence of literal characters and variable
expansions. A variable expansion has the form `$(<name>)', which
represents the value of the `<name>' variable in the current
environment. Some examples are shown below.
<<
     CC = gcc
     CFLAGS = -Wall -g
     COMMAND = $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -O2
>>
  
  In this example, the value of the `COMMAND' variable is the string
`gcc -Wall -g -O2'.
  Unlike make(1), variable expansion is eager and functional (see also
the section on Scoping). That is, variable values are expanded
immediately and new variable definitions do not affect old ones. For
example, suppose we extend the previous example with following variable
definitions.
<<
     X = $(COMMAND)
     COMMAND = $(COMMAND) -O3
     Y = $(COMMAND)
>>
  
  In this example, the value of the `X' variable is the string `gcc
-Wall -g -O2' as before, and the value of the `Y' variable is `gcc -Wall
-g -O2 -O3'.
  

4.2  Adding to a variable definition
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Variables definitions may also use the += operator, which adds the new
text to an existing definition. The following two definitions are
equivalent.
<<
     # Add options to the CFLAGS variable
     CFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -Wall -g
  
     # The following definition is equivalent
     CFLAGS += -Wall -g
>>
  
  

4.3  Arrays
*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Arrays can be defined by appending the `[]' sequence to the variable
name and defining initial values for the elements as separate lines.
Whitespace is significant on each line. The following code sequence
prints `c d e'.
<<
      X[] =
          a b
          c d e
          f
  
      println($(nth 2, $(X)))
>>
  
  

4.4  Special characters and quoting
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  The following characters are special to omake: `$():,=#\'. To treat
any of these characters as normal text, they should be escaped with the
backslash character `\'.
<<
      DOLLAR = \$
>>
  
  Newlines may also be escaped with a backslash to concatenate several
lines.
<<
      FILES = a.c\
              b.c\
              c.c
>>
  
  Note that the backslash is not an escape for any other character, so
the following works as expected (that is, it preserves the backslashes
in the string).
<<
      DOSTARGET = C:\WINDOWS\control.ini
>>
  
  An alternative mechanism for quoting special text is the use `$"..."'
escapes. The number of double-quotations is arbitrary. The outermost
quotations are not included in the text.
<<
      A = $""String containing "quoted text" ""
      B = $"""Multi-line
          text.
          The # character is not special"""

4.5  Function definitions
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

    
  Functions are defined using the following syntax.
<<
     <name>(<params>) =
        <indented-body>
>>
  
  The parameters are a comma-separated list of identifiers, and the body
must be placed on a separate set of lines that are indented from the
function definition itself. For example, the following text defines a
function that concatenates its arguments, separating them with a colon.
<<
      ColonFun(a, b) =
          return($(a):$(b))
>>
  
  The `return' expression can be used to return a value from the
function. A `return' statement is not required; if it is omitted, the
returned value is the value of the last expression in the body to be
evaluated. NOTE: as of version `0.9.6', `return' is a control operation,
causing the function to immediately return. In the following example,
when the argument `a' is true, the function `f' immediately returns the
value 1 without evaluating the print statement.
<<
      f(a) =
         if $(a)
            return 1
         println(The argument is false)
         return 0
>>
  
  In many cases, you may wish to return a value from a section or code
block without returning from the function. In this case, you would use
the `value' operator. In fact, the `value' operator is not limited to
functions, it can be used any place where a value is required. In the
following definition, the variable `X' is defined as 1 or 2, depending
on the value of a, then result is printed, and returned from the
function.
<<
      f_value(a) =
         X =
            if $(a)
               value 1
            else
               value 2
         println(The value of X is $(X))
         value $(X)
>>
  
  Functions are called using the GNU-make syntax, `$(<name> <args))',
where `<args>' is a comma-separated list of values. For example, in the
following program, the variable `X' contains the value `foo:bar'.
<<
     X = $(ColonFun foo, bar)
>>
  
  If the value of a function is not needed, the function may also be
called using standard function call notation. For example, the following
program prints the string ``She says: Hello world''.
<<
      Printer(name) =
          println($(name) says: Hello world)
  
      Printer(She)
>>
  
  

4.6  Comments
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Comments begin with the `#' character and continue to the end of the
line.
  

4.7  File inclusion
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

     
  Files may be included with the `include' form. The included file must
use the same syntax as an OMakefile.
<<
      include files.omake
>>
  
  

4.8  Scoping, sections
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

    
  Scopes in omake are defined by indentation level. When indentation is
increased, such as in the body of a function, a new scope is introduced.
  The `section' form can also be used to define a new scope. For
example, the following code prints the line `X = 2', followed by the
line `X = 1'.
<<
      X = 1
      section
          X = 2
          println(X = $(X))
  
      println(X = $(X))
>>
  
  This result may seem surprising--the variable definition within the
`section' is not visible outside the scope of the `section'.
  The `export' form can be used to circumvent this restriction by
exporting variable values from an inner scope. It must be the final
expression in a scope. For example, if we modify the previous example by
adding an `export' expression, the new value for the `X' variable is
retained, and the code prints the line `X = 2' twice.
<<
      X = 1
      section
          X = 2
          println(X = $(X))
          export
  
      println(X = $(X))
>>
  
  There are also cases where separate scoping is quite important. For
example, each OMakefile is evaluated in its own scope. Since each part
of a project may have its own configuration, it is important that
variable definitions in one OMakefile do not affect the definitions in
another.
  To give another example, in some cases it is convenient to specify a
separate set of variables for different build targets. A frequent idiom
in this case is to use the `section' command to define a separate scope.
<<
     section
        CFLAGS += -g
        %.c: %.y
            $(YACC) $<
        .SUBDIRS: foo
  
     .SUBDIRS: bar baz
>>
  
  In this example, the `-g' option is added to the `CFLAGS' variable by
the `foo' subdirectory, but not by the `bar' and `baz' directories. The
implicit rules are scoped as well and in this example, the newly added
yacc rule will be inherited by the `foo' subdirectory, but not by the
`bar' and `baz' ones; furthermore this implicit rule will not be in
scope in the current directory.
  

4.9  Conditionals
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

     
  Top level conditionals have the following form.
<<
      if <test>
         <true-clause>
      elseif <text>
         <elseif-clause>
      else
         <else-clause>
>>
  
  The `<test>' expression is evaluated, and if it evaluates to a true
value (see Section 8.2 for more information on logical values, and
Boolean functions), the code for the `<true-clause>' is evaluated;
otherwise the remaining clauses are evaluated. There may be multiple
`elseif' clauses; both the `elseif' and `else' clauses are optional.
Note that the clauses are indented, so they introduce new scopes.
  When viewed as a predicate, a value corresponds to the Boolean false,
if its string representation is the empty string, or one of the strings
`false', `no', `nil', `undefined', or `0'. All other values are true.
  The following example illustrates a typical use of a conditional. The
`OSTYPE' variable is the current machine architecture.
<<
      # Common suffixes for files
      if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
         EXT_LIB = .lib
         EXT_OBJ = .obj
         EXT_ASM = .asm
         EXE = .exe
         export
      elseif $(mem $(OSTYPE), Unix Cygwin)
         EXT_LIB = .a
         EXT_OBJ = .o
         EXT_ASM = .s
         EXE =
         export
      else
         # Abort on other architectures
         eprintln(OS type $(OSTYPE) is not recognized)
         exit(1)
>>
  
  

4.10  Matching
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

       
  Pattern matching is performed with the `switch' and `match' forms.
<<
      switch <string>
      case <pattern1>
          <clause1>
      case <pattern2>
          <clause2>
      ...
      default
         <default-clause>
>>
  
  The number of cases is arbitrary. The `default' clause is optional;
however, if it is used it should be the last clause in the pattern
match.
  For `switch', the string is compared with the patterns literally.
<<
      switch $(HOST)
      case mymachine
          println(Building on mymachine)
      default
          println(Building on some other machine)
>>
  
  Patterns need not be constant strings. The following function tests
for a literal match against `pattern1', and a match against `pattern2'
with `##' delimiters.
<<
     Switch2(s, pattern1, pattern2) =
        switch $(s)
        case $(pattern1)
            println(Pattern1)
        case $"##$(pattern2)##"
            println(Pattern2)
        default
            println(Neither pattern matched)
>>
  
  For `match' the patterns are egrep(1)-style regular expressions. The
numeric variables `$1, $2, ...' can be used to retrieve values that are
matched by `\(...\)' expressions.
<<
      match $(NODENAME)@$(SYSNAME)@$(RELEASE)
      case $"mymachine.*@\(.*\)@\(.*\)"
          println(Compiling on mymachine; sysname $1 and release $2 are
ignored)
  
      case $".*@Linux@.*2\.4\.\(.*\)"
          println(Compiling on a Linux 2.4 system; subrelease is $1)
  
      default
          eprintln(Machine configuration not implemented)
          exit(1)
>>
  
  

4.11  Objects
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

    
  OMake is an object-oriented language. Generally speaking, an object is
a value that contains fields and methods. An object is defined with a
`.' suffix for a variable. For example, the following object might be
used to specify a point (1, 5) on the two-dimensional plane.
<<
      Coord. =
          x = 1
          y = 5
          print(message) =
             println($"$(message): the point is ($(x), $(y)")
  
      # Define X to be 5
      X = $(Coord.x)
  
      # This prints the string, "Hi: the point is (1, 5)"
      Coord.print(Hi)
>>
  
  The fields `x' and `y' represent the coordinates of the point. The
method `print' prints out the position of the point.
  

4.12  Classes
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  We can also define classes. For example, suppose we wish to define a
generic `Point' class with some methods to create, move, and print a
point. A class is really just an object with a name, defined with the
`class' directive.
<<
      Point. =
          class Point
  
          # Default values for the fields
          x = 0
          y = 0
  
          # Create a new point from the coordinates
          new(x, y) =
             this.x = $(x)
             this.y = $(y)
             return $(this)
  
          # Move the point to the right
          move-right() =
             x = $(add $(x), 1)
             return $(this)
  
          # Print the point
          print() =
             println($"The point is ($(x), $(y)")
  
      p1 = $(Point.new 1, 5)
      p2 = $(p1.move-right)
  
      # Prints "The point is (1, 5)"
      p1.print()
  
      # Prints "The point is (2, 5)"
      p2.print()
>>
  
  Note that the variable `$(this)' is used to refer to the current
object. Also, classes and objects are functional---the `new' and
`move-right' methods return new objects. In this example, the object
`p2' is a different object from `p1', which retains the original (1, 5)
coordinates.
  

4.13  Inheritance
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Classes and objects support inheritance (including multiple
inheritance) with the `extends' directive. The following definition of
`Point3D' defines a point with `x', `y', and `z' fields. The new object
inherits all of the methods and fields of the parent classes/objects.
<<
      Z. =
         z = 0
  
      Point3D. =
         extends $(Point)
         extends $(Z)
         class Point3D
  
         print() =
            println($"The 3D point is ($(x), $(y), $(z))")
  
      # The "new" method was not redefined, so this
      # defines a new point (1, 5, 0).
      p = $(Point3D.new 1, 5)
>>
  
  

4.14  Special objects/sections
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Objects provide one way to manage the OMake namespace. There are also
four special objects that are further used to control the namespace.
  

4.15  private.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  The `private.' section is used to define variables that are private to
the current file/scope. The values are not accessible outside the scope.
Variables defined in a `private.' object can be accessed only from
within the section where they are defined.
<<
      Obj. =
         private. =
            X = 1
  
         print() =
            println(The value of X is: $(X))
  
      # Prints:
      #    The private value of X is: 1
      Obj.print()
  
      # This is an error--X is private in Obj
      y = $(Obj.X)
>>
  
  In addition, private definitions do not affect the global value of a
variable.
<<
     # The public value of x is 1
     x = 1
     f() =
         println(The public value of x is: $(x))
  
     # This object uses a private value of x
     Obj. =
         private. =
            x = 2
  
         print() =
            x = 3
            println(The private value of x is: $(x))
            f()
  
     # Prints:
     #    The private value of x is: 3
     #    The public value of x is: 1
     Obj.print()
>>
  
  Private variables have two additional properties.
  
  
 1. Private variables are local to the file in which they are defined. 
 2. Private variables are not exported by the `export' directive, unless
   they are  mentioned explicitly.
   <<
            private. =
               FLAG = true
     
            section
               FLAG = false
               export
     
            # FLAG is still true
            section
               FLAG = false
               export FLAG
     
            # FLAG is now false
       >>
  
  

4.16  protected.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  The `protected.' object is used to define fields that are local to an
object. They can be accessed as fields, but they are not passed
dynamically to other functions. The purpose of a protected variable is
to prevent a variable definition within the object from affecting other
parts of the project.
<<
      X = 1
      f() =
         println(The public value of X is: $(X))
  
      # Prints:
      #    The public value of X is: 2
      section
         X = 2
         f()
  
      # X is a protected field in the object
      Obj. =
         protected. =
            X = 3
  
         print() =
            println(The protected value of X is: $(X))
            f()
  
      # Prints:
      #    The protected value of X is: 3
      #    The public value of X is: 1
      Obj.print()
  
      # This is legal, it defines Y as 3
      Y = $(Obj.X)
>>
  
  In general, it is a good idea to define object variables as protected.
The resulting code is more modular because variables in your object will
not produce unexpected clashes with variables defined in other parts of
the project.
  

4.17  public.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  The `public.' object is used to specify public dynamically-scoped
variables. In the following example, the `public.' object specifies that
the value `X = 4' is to be dynamically scoped. Public variables are not
defined as fields of an object.
<<
      X = 1
      f() =
         println(The public value of X is: $(X))
  
      # Prints:
      #    The public value of X is: 2
      section
         X = 2
         f()
  
      Obj. =
         protected. =
            X = 3
  
         print() =
            println(The protected value of X is: $(X))
            public. =
               X = 4
            f()
  
      # Prints:
      #    The protected value of X is: 3
      #    The public value of X is: 4
      Obj.print()
>>
  
  

4.18  static.
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  The `static.' object is used to specify values that are persistent
across runs of OMake. They are frequently used for configuring a
project. Configuring a project can be expensive, so the `static.' object
ensure that the configuration is performed just once. In the following
(somewhat trivial) example, a `static' section is used to determine if
the LaTeX command is available. The `$(where latex)' function returns
the full pathname for `latex', or `false' if the command is not found.
<<
     static. =
        LATEX_ENABLED = false
        print(--- Determining if LaTeX is installed )
        if $(where latex)
            LATEX_ENABLED = true
            export
  
        if $(LATEX_ENABLED)
           println($'(enabled)')
        else
           println($'(disabled)')
>>
  
  As a matter of style, a `static.' section that is used for
configuration should print what it is doing, using `---' as a print
prefix.
  

4.19  Short syntax for scoping objects
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  The usual dot-notation can be used for private, protected, and public
variables (but not static variables).
<<
      # Public definition of X
      public.X = 1
  
      # Private definition of X
      private.X = 2
  
      # Prints:
      #    The public value of X is: 1
      #    The private value of X is: 2
      println(The public value of X is: $(public.X))
      println(The private value of X is: $(private.X))
>>
  
  

4.20  Modular programming
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  The scoping objects help provide a form of modularity. When you write
a new file or program, explicit scoping declarations can be used to
define an explicit interface for your code, and help avoid name clashes
with other parts of the project. Variable definitions are public by
default, but you can control this with private definitions.
<<
      # These variables are private to this file
      private. =
         FILES = foo1 foo2 foo3
         SUFFIX = .o
         OFILES = $(addsuffix $(SUFFIX), $(FILES))
  
      # These variables are public
      public. =
         CFLAGS += -g
  
      # Build the files with the -g option
      $(OFILES):
>>
  


Chapter 5    Expressions and values
***********************************
    
  omake provides a full programming-language including many system and
IO functions. The language is object-oriented -- everything is an
object, including the base values like numbers and strings. However, the
omake language differs from other scripting languages in three main
respects.
  
  
 - Scoping is dynamic. 
 - Apart from IO, the language is entirely functional -- there is no 
   assignment operator in the language. 
 - Evaluation is normally eager -- that is, expressions are evaluated as
   soon  as they are encountered. 
  
  To illustrate these features, we will use the osh(1) omake program
shell. The osh(1) program provides a toploop, where expressions can be
entered and the result printed. osh(1) normally interprets input as
command text to be executed by the shell, so in many cases we will use
the `value' form to evaluate an expression directly.
<<
      osh> 1
      *** omake error: File -: line 1, characters 0-1 command not found:

      osh> value 1
      - : "1" : Sequence

>>
  
  

5.1  Dynamic scoping
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Dynamic scoping means that the value of a variable is determined by
the most recent binding of the variable in scope at runtime. Consider
the following program.
<<
      OPTIONS = a b c
      f() =
         println(OPTIONS = $(OPTIONS))
      g() =
         OPTIONS = d e f
         f()
>>
  
  If `f()' is called without redefining the `OPTIONS' variable, the
function should print the string `OPTIONS = a b c'.
  In contrast, the function `g()' redefines the `OPTIONS' variable and
evaluates `f()' in that scope, which now prints the string `OPTIONS = d
e f'.
  The body of `g' defines a local scope -- the redefinition of the
`OPTIONS' variable is local to `g' and does not persist after the
function terminates.
<<
      osh> g()
      OPTIONS = d e f
      osh> f()
      OPTIONS = a b c
>>
  
  Dynamic scoping can be tremendously helpful for simplifying the code
in a project. For example, the OMakeroot file defines a set of functions
and rules for building projects using such variables as `CC', `CFLAGS',
etc. However, different parts of a project may need different values for
these variables. For example, we may have a subdirectory called `opt'
where we want to use the `-03' option, and a subdirectory called `debug'
where we want to use the `-g' option. Dynamic scoping allows us to
redefine these variables in the parts of the project without having to
redefine the functions that use them.
<<
      section
         CFLAGS = -O3
         .SUBDIRS: opt
      section
         CFLAGS = -g
         .SUBDIRS: debug
>>
  
  However, dynamic scoping also has drawbacks. First, it can become
confusing: you might have a variable that is intended to be private, but
it is accidentally redefined elsewhere. For example, you might have the
following code to construct search paths.
<<
     PATHSEP = :
     make-path(dirs) =
        return $(concat $(PATHSEP), $(dirs))
  
     make-path(/bin /usr/bin /usr/X11R6/bin)
     - : "/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin" : String
>>
  
  However, elsewhere in the project, the `PATHSEP' variable is redefined
as a directory separator `/', and your function suddenly returns the
string `/bin//usr/bin//usr/X11R6/bin', obviously not what you want.
  The `private' block is used to solve this problem. Variables that are
defined in a `private' block use static scoping -- that is, the value of
the variable is determined by the most recent definition in scope in the
source text.
<<
     private
        PATHSEP = :
     make-path(dirs) =
        return $(concat $(PATHSEP), $(dirs))
  
     PATHSEP = /
     make-path(/bin /usr/bin /usr/X11R6/bin)
     - : "/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin" : String
>>
  
  

5.2  Functional evaluation
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Apart from I/O, omake programs are entirely functional. This has two
parts:
  
  
 - There is no assignment operator. 
 - Functions are values, and may be passed as arguments, and returned
   from  functions just like any other value. 
  
  The second item is straightforward. For example, the following program
defines an increment function by returning a function value.

     incby(n) =

  The first item may be the most confusing initially. Without
assignment, how is it possible for a subproject to modify the global
behavior of the project? In fact, the omission is intentional. Build
scripts are much easier to write when there is a guarantee that
subprojects do not interfere with one another.
  However, there are times when a subproject needs to propagate
information back to its parent object, or when an inner scope needs to
propagate information back to the outer scope.
  The `export' directive can be used to propagate all or part of an
inner scope back to its parent. The `export' directive should be the
last statement in a block. If used without arguments, the entire scope
is propagated back to the parent; otherwise the arguments should be the
names of variables to propagate. The most common usage is to export the
definitions in a conditional block. In the following example, the
variable `B' is bound to 2 after the conditional. The `A' variable is
not redefined.
<<
      if $(test)
         A = 1
         B = $(add $(A), 1)
         export B
      else
         B = 2
         export
>>
  
  

5.3  Eager evaluation
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Evaluation in omake is eager. That is, expressions are evaluated as
soon as they are encountered by the evaluator. One effect of this is
that the right-hand-side of a variable definition is expanded when the
variable is defined.
<<
      osh> A = 1
      - : "1"
      osh> A = $(A)$(A)
      - : "11"
>>
  
  In the second definition, `A = $(A)$(A)', the right-hand-side is
evaluated first, producing the sequence `11'. Then the variable `A' is
redefined as the new value. When combined with dynamic scoping, this has
many of the same properties as conventional imperative programming.
<<
      osh> A = 1
      - : "1"
      osh> printA() =
          println($"A = $A")
      osh> A = $(A)$(A)
      - : "11"
      osh> printA()
      11
>>
  
  In this example, the print function is defined in the scope of `A'.
When it is called on the last line, the dynamic value of `A' is `11',
which is what is printed.
  However, dynamic scoping and imperative programming should not be
confused. The following example illustrates a difference. The second
`printA' is not in the scope of the definition `A = x$(A)$(A)x', so it
prints the original value, `1'.
<<
      osh> A = 1
      - : "1"
      osh> printA() =
          println($"A = $A")
      osh> section
               A = x$(A)$(A)x
               printA()
      x11x
      osh> printA()
      1
>>
  
  See also Section 6.5 for further ways to control the evaluation order
through the use of ``lazy'' expressions.
  

5.4  Objects
*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  omake is an object-oriented language. Everything is an object,
including base values like numbers and strings. In many projects, this
may not be so apparent because most evaluation occurs in the default
toplevel object, the `Pervasives' object, and few other objects are ever
defined.
  However, objects provide additional means for data structuring, and in
some cases judicious use of objects may simplify your project.
  Objects are defined with the following syntax. This defines `name' to
be an object with several methods an values.
<<
      name. =                     # += may be used as well
         extends parent-object    # optional
         class class-name         # optional
  
         # Fields
         X = value
         Y = value
  
         # Methods
         f(args) =
            body
         g(arg) =
            body
>>
  
  An `extends' directive specifies that this object inherits from the
specified `parent-object'. The object may have any number of `extends'
directives. If there is more than on `extends' directive, then fields
and methods are inherited from all parent objects. If there are name
conflicts, the later definitions override the earlier definitions.
  The `class' directive is optional. If specified, it defines a name for
the object that can be used in `instanceof' operations, as well as `::'
scoping directives discussed below.
  The body of the object is actually an arbitrary program. The variables
defined in the body of the object become its fields, and the functions
defined in the body become its methods.
  

5.5  Field and method calls
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  The fields and methods of an object are named using `object.name'
notation. For example, let's define a one-dimensional point value.
<<
     Point. =
        class Point
  
        # Default value
        x = $(int 0)
  
        # Create a new point
        new(x) =
           x = $(int $(x))
           return $(this)
  
        # Move by one
        move() =
           x = $(add $(x), 1)
           return $(this)
  
     osh> p1 = $(Point.new 15)
     osh> value $(p1.x)
     - : 15 : Int
  
     osh> p2 = $(p1.move)
     osh> value $(p2.x)
     - : 16 : Int
>>
  
  The `$(this)' variable always represents the current object. The
expression `$(p1.x)' fetches the value of the `x' field in the `p1'
object. The expression `$(Point.new 15)' represents a method call to the
`new' method of the `Point' object, which returns a new object with 15
as its initial value. The expression `$(p1.move)' is also a method call,
which returns a new object at position 16.
  Note that objects are functional --- it is not possible to modify the
fields or methods of an existing object in place. Thus, the `new' and
`move' methods return new objects.
  

5.6  Method override
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Suppose we wish to create a new object that moves by 2 units, instead
of just 1. We can do it by overriding the `move' method.
<<
     Point2. =
        extends $(Point)
  
        # Override the move method
        move() =
           x = $(add $(x), 2)
           return $(this)
  
     osh> p2 = $(Point2.new 15)
     osh> p3 = $(p2.move)
     osh> value $(p3.x)
     - : 17 : Int
>>
  
  However, by doing this, we have completely replaced the old `move'
method.
  

5.7  Super calls
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Suppose we wish to define a new `move' method that just calls the old
one twice. We can refer to the old definition of move using a super
call, which uses the notation `$(classname::name <args>)'. The
`classname' should be the name of the superclass, and `name' the field
or method to be referenced. An alternative way of defining the `Point2'
object is then as follows.
<<
     Point2. =
        extends $(Point)
  
        # Call the old method twice
        move() =
           this = $(Point::move)
           return $(Point::move)
>>
  
  Note that the first call to `$(Point::move)' redefines the current
object (the `this' variable). This is because the method returns a new
object, which is re-used for the second call.


Chapter 6    Additional language examples
*****************************************
    
  In this section, we'll explore the core language through a series of
examples (examples of the build system are the topic of the Chapter 3).
  For most of these examples, we'll use the `osh' command interpreter.
For simplicity, the values printed by `osh' have been abbreviated.
  

6.1  Strings and arrays
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  The basic OMake values are strings, sequences, and arrays of values.
Sequences are like arrays of values separated by whitespace; the
sequences are split on demand by functions that expect arrays.
<<
     osh> X = 1 2
     - : "1 2" : Sequence
     osh> addsuffix(.c, $X)
     - : <array 1.c 2.c> : Array
>>
  
  Sometimes you want to define an array explicitly. For this, use the
`[]' brackets after the variable name, and list each array entry on a
single indented line.
<<
     osh> A[] =
             Hello world
             $(getenv HOME)
     - : <array "Hello world" "/home/jyh"> : Array
>>
  
  One central property of arrays is that whitespace in the elements is
significant. This can be useful, especially for filenames that contain
whitespace. 
<<
     # List the current files in the directory
      osh> ls -Q
      "fee"  "fi"  "foo"  "fum"
      osh> NAME[] = 
              Hello world
      - : <array "Hello world"> : Array
      osh> touch $(NAME)
      osh> ls -Q
      "fee"  "fi"  "foo"  "fum"  "Hello world"
>>
  
  

6.2  Quoted strings
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  A `String' is a single value; whitespace is significant in a string.
Strings are introduced with quotes. There are four kinds of quoted
elements; the kind is determined by the opening quote. The symbols `''
(single-quote) and `"' (double-quote) introduce the normal shell-style
quoted elements. The quotation symbols are included in the result
string. Variables are always expanded within a quote of this kind. Note
that the osh(1) (Chapter 13) printer escapes double-quotes within the
string; these are only for printing, they are not part of the string
itself.
<<
      osh> A = 'Hello "world"'
      - : "'Hello \"world\"'" : String
      osh> B = "$(A)"
      - : "\"'Hello \"world\"'\"" : String
      osh> C = 'Hello \'world\''
      - : "'Hello 'world''" : String
>>
  
  A second kind of quote is introduced with the `$'' and `$"' quotes.
The number of opening and closing quote symbols is arbitrary. These
quotations have several properties: 
  
 - The quote delimiters are not part of the string. 
 - Backslash `\' symbols within the string are treated as normal
   characters. 
 - The strings may span several lines. 
 - Variables are expanded within `$"' sequences, but not within `$'' 
   sequences. 
  
<<
      osh> A = $'''Here $(IS) an '''' \(example\) string['''
      - : "Here $(IS) an '''' \\(example\\) string[" : String
      osh> B = $""""A is "$(A)" """"
      - : "A is \"Here $(IS) an '''' \\(example\\) string[\" " : String
      osh> value $(A.length)
      - : 38 : Int
      osh> value $(A.nth 5)
      - : "$" : String
      osh> value $(A.rev)
      - : "[gnirts )\\elpmaxe(\\ '''' na )SI($ ereH" : String
>>
  
  Strings and sequences both have the property that they can be merged
with adjacent non-whitespace text.
<<
      osh> A = a b c
      - : "a b c" : Sequence
      osh> B = $(A).c
      - : <sequence "a b c" : Sequence ".c" : Sequence> : Sequence
      osh> value $(nth 2, $(B))
      - : "c.c" : String
      osh> value $(length $(B))
      - : 3 : Int
>>
  
  Arrays are different. The elements of an array are never merged with
adjacent text of any kind. Arrays are defined by adding square brackets
`[]' after a variable name and defining the elements with an indented
body. The elements may include whitespace.
<<
      osh> A[] =
              a b
              foo bar
      - : <array
             "a b" : Sequence
             "foo bar" : Sequence>
             : Array
      osh> echo $(A).c
      a b foo bar .c
      osh> value $(A.length)
      - : 2 : Int
      osh> value $(A.nth 1)
      - : "foo bar" : Sequence
>>
  
  Arrays are quite helpful on systems where filenames often contain
whitespace.
<<
      osh> FILES[] =
               c:\Documents and Settings\jyh\one file
               c:\Program Files\omake\second file
  
      osh> CFILES = $(addsuffix .c, $(FILES))
      osh> echo $(CFILES)
      c:\Documents and Settings\jyh\one file.c c:\Program
Files\omake\second file.c
>>
  
  

6.3  Files and directories
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  OMake projects usually span multiple directories, and different parts
of the project execute commands in different directories. There is a
need to define a location-independent name for a file or directory.
  This is done with the `$(file <names>)' and `$(dir <names>)'
functions.
<<
     osh> mkdir tmp
     osh> F = $(file fee)
     osh> section:
              cd tmp
              echo $F
     ../fee
     osh> echo $F
     fee
>>
  
  Note the use of a `section:' to limit the scope of the `cd' command.
The section temporarily changes to the `tmp' directory where the name of
the file is `../fee'. Once the section completes, we are still in the
current directory, where the name of the file is `fee'.
  One common way to use the file functions is to define proper file
names in your project `OMakefile', so that references within the various
parts of the project will refer to the same file.
<<
      osh> cat OMakefile
      ROOT = $(dir .)
      TMP  = $(dir tmp)
      BIN  = $(dir bin)
      ...
>>
  
  

6.4  Iteration, mapping, and foreach
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Most builtin functions operate transparently on arrays.
<<
      osh> addprefix(-D, DEBUG WIN32)
      - : -DDEBUG -DWIN32 : Array
      osh> mapprefix(-I, /etc /tmp)
      - : -I /etc -I /tmp : Array
      osh> uppercase(fee fi foo fum)
      - : FEE FI FOO FUM : Array
>>
  
  The `mapprefix' and `addprefix' functions are slightly different (the
`addsuffix' and `mapsuffix' functions are similar). The `addprefix' adds
the prefex to each array element. The `mapprefix' doubles the length of
the array, adding the prefix as a new array element before each of the
original elements.
  Even though most functions work on arrays, there are times when you
will want to do it yourself. The `foreach' function is the way to go.
The `foreach' function has two forms, but the form with a body is most
useful. In this form, the function takes two arguments and a body. The
second argument is an array, and the first is a variable. The body is
evaluated once for each element of the array, where the variable is
bound to the element. Let's define a function to add 1 to each element
of an array of numbers.
<<
     osh> add1(l) =
              foreach(i, $l):
                  add($i, 1)
     osh> add1(7 21 75)
     - : 8 22 76 : Array
>>
  
  Sometimes you have an array of filenames, and you want to define a
rule for each of them. Rules are not special, you can define them
anywhere a statement is expected. Say we want to write a function that
describes how to process each file, placing the result in the `tmp/'
directory.
<<
     TMP = $(dir tmp)
  
     my-special-rule(files) =
        foreach(name, $(files))
           $(TMP)/$(name): $(name)
              process $< > $@
>>
  
  Later, in some other part of the project, we may decide that we want
to use this function to process some files.
<<
     # These are the files to process in src/lib
     MY_SPECIAL_FILES[] =
         fee.src
         fi.src
         file with spaces in its name.src
     my-special-rule($(MY_SPECIAL_FILES))
>>
  
  The result of calling `my-special-rule' is exactly the same as if we
had written the following three rules explicitly.
<<
      $(TMP)/fee.src: fee.src
          process fee > $@
      $(TMP)/fi.src: fi.src
          process fi.src > $@
      $(TMP)/$"file with spaces in its name.src": $"file with spaces in
its name.src"
          process $< > $@
>>
  
  Of course, writing these rules is not nearly as pleasant as calling
the function. The usual properties of function abstraction give us the
usual benefits. The code is less redundant, and there is a single
location (the `my-special-rule' function) that defines the build rule.
Later, if we want to modify/update the rule, we need do so in only one
location.
  

6.5  Lazy expressions
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Evaluation in omake is normally eager. That is, expressions are
evaluated as soon as they are encountered by the evaluator. One effect
of this is that the right-hand-side of a variable definition is expanded
when the variable is defined.
  There are two ways to control this behavior. The `$`(v)' form
introduces lazy behavior, and the `$,(v)' form restores eager behavior.
Consider the following sequence.
<<
      osh> A = 1
      - : "1" : Sequence
      osh> B = 2
      - : "2" : Sequence
      osh> C = $`(add $(A), $,(B))
      - : $(apply add $(apply A) "2" : Sequence)
      osh> println(C = $(C))
      C = 3
      osh> A = 5
      - : "5" : Sequence
      osh> B = 6
      - : "6" : Sequence
      osh> println(C = $(C))
      C = 7
>>
  
  The definition `C = $`(add $(A), $,(B))' defines a lazy application.
The `add' function is not applied in this case until its value is
needed. Within this expression, the value `$,(B)' specifies that `B' is
to be evaluated immediately, even though it is defined in a lazy
expression.
  The first time that we print the value of `C', it evaluates to 3 since
`A' is 1 and `B' is 2. The second time we evaluate `C', it evaluates to
7 because `A' has been redefined to `5'. The second definition of `B'
has no effect, since it was evaluated at definition time.
  

6.5.1  A larger example of lazy expressions
===========================================
  
  Lazy expressions are not evaluated until their result is needed. Some
people, including this author, frown on overuse of lazy expressions,
mainly because it is difficult to know when evaluation actually happens.
However, there are cases where they pay off.
  One example comes from option processing. Consider the specification
of ``include'' directories on the command line for a C compiler. If we
want to include files from /home/jyh/include and ../foo, we specify it
on the command line with the options `-I/home/jyh/include -I../foo'.
  Suppose we want to define a generic rule for building C files. We
could define a `INCLUDES' array to specify the directories to be
included, and then define a generic implicit rule in our root OMakefile.
<<
      # Generic way to compile C files.
      CFLAGS = -g
      INCLUDES[] =
      %.o: %.c
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $<
  
      # The src directory builds my_widget+ from 4 source files.
      # It reads include files from the include directory.
      .SUBDIRS: src
          FILES = fee fi foo fum
          OFILES = $(addsuffix .o, $(FILES))
          INCLUDES[] += -I../include
          my_widget: $(OFILES)
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(OFILES)
>>
  
  But this is not quite right. The problem is that INCLUDES is an array
of options, not directories. If we later wanted to recover the
directories, we would have to strip the leading `-I' prefix, which is a
hassle. Furthermore, we aren't using proper names for the directories.
The solution here is to use a lazy expression. We'll define INCLUDES as
a directory array, and a new variable `PREFIXED_INCLUDES' that adds the
-I prefix. The `PREFIXED_INCLUDES' is computed lazily, ensuring that the
value uses the most recent value of the INCLUDES variable.
<<
      # Generic way to compile C files.
      CFLAGS = -g
      INCLUDES[] =
      PREFIXED_INCLUDES[] = $`(addprefix -I, $(INCLUDES))
      %.o: %.c
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(PREFIXED_INCLUDES) -c $<
  
      # For this example, we define a proper name for the include
directory
      STDINCLUDE = $(dir include)
  
      # The src directory builds my_widget+ from 4 source files.
      # It reads include files from the include directory.
      .SUBDIRS: src
          FILES = fee fi foo fum
          OFILES = $(addsuffix .o, $(FILES))
          INCLUDES[] += $(STDINCLUDE)
          my_widget: $(OFILES)
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(OFILES)
>>
  
  Note that there is a close connection between lazy values and
functions. In the example above, we could equivalently define
`PREFIXED_INCLUDES' as a function with zero arguments.
<<
      PREFIXED_INCLUDES() =
          addprefix(-I, $(INCLUDES))
>>
  
  

6.6  Scoping and exports
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  The OMake language is functional (apart from IO and shell commands).
This comes in two parts: functions are first-class, and variables are
immutable (there is no assignment operator). The latter property may
seem strange to users used to GNU make, but it is actually a central
point of OMake. Since variables can't be modified, it is impossible (or
at least hard) for one part of the project to interfere with another.
  To be sure, pure functional programming can be awkward. In OMake, each
new indentation level introduces a new scope, and new definitions in
that scope are lost when the scope ends. If OMake were overly strict
about scoping, we would wind up with a lot of convoluted code.
<<
     osh> X = 1
     osh> setenv(BOO, 12)
     osh> if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
              setenv(BOO, 17)
              X = 2
     osh> println($X $(getenv BOO))
     1 12
>>
  
  The `export' command presents a way out. It takes care of
``exporting'' a value (or the entire variable environment) from an inner
scope to an outer one.
<<
     osh> X = 1
     osh> setenv(BOO, 12)
     osh> if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
              setenv(BOO, 17)
              X = 2
              export
     osh> println($X $(getenv BOO))
     2 17
>>
  
  Exports are especially useful in loop to export values from one
iteration of a loop to the next.
<<
     # Ok, let's try to add up the elements of the array
     osh>sum(l) =
             total = 0
             foreach(i, $l)
                 total = $(add $(total), $i)
             value $(total)
     osh>sum(1 2 3)
     - : 0 : Int
  
     # Oops, that didn't work!
     osh>sum(l) =
             total = 0
             foreach(i, $l)
                 total = $(add $(total), $i)
                 export
             value $(total)
     osh>sum(1 2 3)
     - : 6 : Int
>>
  
  A `while' loop is another form of loop, with an auto-export.
<<
      osh>i = 0
      osh>total = 0
      osh>while $(lt $i, 10)
              total = $(add $(total), $i)
              i = $(add $i, 1)
      osh>println($(total))
      45
>>
  
  

6.7  Shell aliases
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Sometimes you may want to define an alias, an OMake command that
masquerades as a real shell command. You can do this by adding your
function as a method to the `Shell' object.
  For an example, suppose we use the `awk' function to print out all the
comments in a file.
<<
      osh>cat comment.om
      # Comment function
      comments(filename) =
          awk($(filename))
          case $'^#'
              println($0)
      # File finished
      osh>include comment
      osh>comments(comment.om)
      # Comment function
      # File finished
>>
  
  To add it as an alias, add the method (using += to preserve the
existing entries in the Shell).
<<
     osh>Shell. +=
             printcom(argv) =
                 comments($(nth 0, $(argv)))
     osh>printcom comment.om > output.txt
     osh>cat output.txt
     # Comment function
     # File finished
>>
  
  A shell command is passed an array of arguments `argv'. This does not
include the name of the alias.
  

6.8  Input/output redirection on the cheap
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  As it turns out, scoping also provides a nice alternate way to perform
redirection. Suppose you have already written a lot of code that prints
to the standard output channel, but now you decide you want to redirect
it. One way to do it is using the technique in the previous example:
define your function as an alias, and then use shell redirection to
place the output where you want.
  There is an alternate method that is easier in some cases. The
variables `stdin', `stdout', and `stderr' define the standard I/O
channels. To redirect output, redefine these variables as you see fit.
Of course, you would normally do this in a nested scope, so that the
outer channels are not affected.
<<
      osh>f() =
              println(Hello world)
      osh>f()
      Hello world
      osh>section:
              stdout = $(fopen output.txt, w)
              f()
              close($(stdout))
      osh>cat output.txt
      Hello world
>>
  
  This also works for shell commands. If you like to gamble, you can try
the following example.
<<
      osh>f() =
              println(Hello world)
      osh>f()
      Hello world
      osh>section:
              stdout = $(fopen output.txt, w)
              f()
              cat output.txt
              close($(stdout))
      osh>cat output.txt
      Hello world
      Hello world
>>
  


Chapter 7    Rules
******************
    
  Rules are used by OMake to specify how to build files. At its
simplest, a rule has the following form.
<<
      <target>: <dependencies>
          <commands>
>>
  
  The `<target>' is the name of a file to be built. The `<dependencies>'
are a list of files that are needed before the `<target>' can be built.
The `<commands>' are a list of indented lines specifying commands to
build the target. For example, the following rule specifies how to
compile a file `hello.c'.
<<
      hello.o: hello.c
          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o hello.o hello.c
>>
  
  This rule states that the hello.o file depends on the hello.c file. If
the hello.c file has changed, the command `$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o hello.o
hello.c' is to be executed to update the target file `hello.o'.
  A rule can have an arbitrary number of commands. The individual
command lines are executed independently by the command shell. The
commands do not have to begin with a tab, but they must be indented from
the dependency line.
  In addition to normal variables, the following special variables may
be used in the body of a rule.
  
  
 - `$*': the target name, without a suffix. 
 - `$@': the target name. 
 - `$^': a list of the sources, in alphabetical order, with duplicates
   removed. 
 - `$'+: all the sources, in the original order. 
 - `$<': the first source. 
  
  For example, the above `hello.c' rule may be simplified as follows.
<<
      hello.o: hello.c
          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<
>>
  
  Unlike normal values, the variables in a rule body are expanded
lazily, and binding is dynamic. The following function definition
illustrates some of the issues.
<<
      CLibrary(name, files) =
          OFILES = $(addsuffix .o, $(files))
  
          $(name).a: $(OFILES)
              $(AR) cq $@ $(OFILES)
>>
  
  This function defines a rule to build a program called `$(name)' from
a list of `.o' files. The files in the argument are specified without a
suffix, so the first line of the function definition defines a variable
`OFILES' that adds the `.o' suffix to each of the file names. The next
step defines a rule to build a target library `$(name).a' from the
`$(OFILES)' files. The expression `$(AR)' is evaluated when the function
is called, and the value of the variable `AR' is taken from the caller's
scope (see also the section on Scoping).
  

7.1  Implicit rules
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Rules may also be implicit. That is, the files may be specified by
wildcard patterns. The wildcard character is `%'. For example, the
following rule specifies a default rule for building `.o' files.
<<
      %.o: %.c
          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $*.c
>>
  
  This rule is a template for building an arbitrary `.o' file from a
`.c' file.
  By default, implicit rules are only used for the targets in the
current directory. However subdirectories included via the `.SUBDIRS'
rules inherit all the implicit rules that are in scope (see also the
section on Scoping).
  

7.2  Bounded implicit rules
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Implicit rules may specify the set of files they apply to. The
following syntax is used.
<<
      <targets>: <pattern>: <dependencies>
          <commands>
>>
  
  For example, the following rule applies only to the files `a.o' and
`b.o'.
<<
     a.o b.o: %.o: %.c
          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -DSPECIAL -c $*.c
>>
  
  

7.3  section
*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  Frequently, the commands in a rule body are expressions to be
evaluated by the shell. omake also allows expressions to be evaluated by
omake itself.
  The syntax of these ``computed rules'' uses the `section' expression.
The following rule uses the omake IO functions to produce the target
`hello.c'.
<<
      hello.c:
          section
              FP = fopen(hello.c, w)
              fprintln($(FP), $""#include <stdio.h> int main() {
printf("Hello world\n"); }"")
              close($(FP))
>>
  
  This example uses the quotation `$""...""' (see also Section B.1.6) to
quote the text being printed. These quotes are not included in the
output file. The `fopen', `fprintln', and `close' functions perform file
IO as discussed in the IO section.
  In addition, commands that are function calls, or special expressions,
are interpreted correctly. Since the `fprintln' function can take a file
directly, the above rule can be abbreviated as follows.
<<
      hello.c:
         fprintln($@, $""#include <stdio.h> int main() { printf("Hello
world\n"); }"")
>>
  
  

7.4  section rule
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Rules can also be computed using the `section rule' form, where a rule
body is expected instead of an expression. In the following rule, the
file `a.c' is copied onto the `hello.c' file if it exists, otherwise
`hello.c' is created from the file `default.c'.
<<
      hello.c:
          section rule
             if $(target-exists a.c)
                hello.c: a.c
                   cat a.c > hello.c
             else
                hello.c: default.c
                   cp default.c hello.c
>>
  
  

7.5  Special dependencies
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  

7.5.1  :exists:
===============
   
  In some cases, the contents of a dependency do not matter, only
whether the file exists or not. In this case, the `:exists:' qualifier
can be used for the dependency.
<<
      foo.c: a.c :exists: .flag
         if $(test -e .flag)
             $(CP) a.c $@
>>
  
  

7.5.2  :effects:
================
   
  Some commands produce files by side-effect. For example, the latex(1)
command produces a `.aux' file as a side-effect of producing a `.dvi'
file. In this case, the `:effects:' qualifier can be used to list the
side-effect explicitly. omake is careful to avoid simultaneously running
programs that have overlapping side-effects.
<<
      paper.dvi: paper.tex :effects: paper.aux
          latex paper
>>
  
  

7.5.3  :value:
==============
   
  The `:value:' dependency is used to specify that the rule execution
depends on the value of an expression. For example, the following rule
<<
      a: b c :value: $(X)
          ...
>>
  
  specifies that ``a'' should be recompiled if the value of `$(X)'
changes (X does not have to be a filename). This is intended to allow
greater control over dependencies.
  In addition, it can be used instead of other kinds of dependencies.
For example, the following rule:
<<
      a: b :exists: c
          commands
>>
  
  is the same as
<<
      a: b :value: $(target-exists c)
          commands
>>
  
  Notes: 
  
 - The values are arbitrary (they are not limited to variables) 
 - The values are evaluated at rule expansion time, so expressions
   containing variables like `$@', `$^', etc are legal. 
  
  

7.6  .SCANNER rules
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Scanner rules define a way to specify automatic dependency scanning. A
`.SCANNER' rule has the following form.
<<
      .SCANNER: target: dependencies
          commands
>>
  
  The rule is used to compute additional dependencies that might be
defined in the source files for the specified target. The scanner
produces dependencies for the specified target (which may be a pattern)
by running the commands, which must produce output that is compatible
with omake. For example, on GNU systems the `gcc -MM foo.c' produces
dependencies for the file `foo.c' (based on `#include' information).
  We can use this to specify a scanner for C files that adds the scanned
dependencies for the `.o' file. The following scanner specifies that
dependencies for a file, say `foo.o' can be computed by running `gcc -MM
foo.c'. Furthermore, `foo.c' is a dependency, so the scanner should be
recomputed whenever the `foo.c' file changes.
<<
      .SCANNER: %.o: %.c
          gcc -MM $<
>>
  
  Let's suppose that the command `gcc -MM foo.c' prints the following
line.
<<
      foo.o: foo.h /usr/include/stdio.h
>>
  
  The result is that the files `foo.h' and `/usr/include/stdio.h' are
considered to be dependencies of `foo.o'---that is, `foo.o' should be
rebuilt if either of these files changes.
  This works, to an extent. One nice feature is that the scanner will be
re-run whenever the `foo.c' file changes. However, one problem is that
dependencies in C are recursive. That is, if the file `foo.h' is
modified, it might include other files, establishing further
dependencies. What we need is to re-run the scanner if `foo.h' changes
too.
  We can do this with a value dependency. The variable `$&' is defined
as the dependency results from any previous scan. We can add these as
dependencies using the `digest' function, which computes an MD5 digest
of the files.
<<
      .SCANNER: %.o: %.c :value: $(digest $&)
          gcc -MM $<
>>
  
  Now, when the file `foo.h' changes, its digest will also change, and
the scanner will be re-run because of the value dependency (since `$&'
will include `foo.h').
  This still is not quite right. The problem is that the C compiler uses
a search-path for include files. There may be several versions of the
file `foo.h', and the one that is chosen depends on the include path.
What we need is to base the dependencies on the search path.
  The `$(digest-in-path-optional ...)' function computes the digest
based on a search path, giving us a solution that works.
<<
      .SCANNER: %.o: %.c :value: $(digest-in-path-optional $(INCLUDES),
$&)
         gcc -MM $(addprefix -I, $(INCLUDES)) $<
>>
  
  

7.7  Named scanners, and the :scanner: target
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Sometimes it may be useful to specify explicitly which scanner should
be used in a rule. For example, we might compile `.c' files with
different options, or (heaven help us) we may be using both `gcc' and
the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler `cl'. In general, the target of a
`.SCANNER' is not tied to a particular target, and we may name it as we
like.
<<
      .SCANNER: scan-gcc-%.c: %.c :value: $(digest-in-path-optional
$(INCLUDES), $&)
          gcc -MM $(addprefix -I, $(INCLUDES)) $<
  
      .SCANNER: scan-cl-%.c: %.c :value: $(digest-in-path-optional
$(INCLUDES), $&)
          cl --scan-dependencies-or-something $(addprefix /I,
$(INCLUDES)) $<
>>
  
  The next step is to define explicit scanner dependencies. The
`:scanner:' dependency is used for this. In this case, the scanner
dependencies are specified explicitly.
<<
      $(GCC_FILES): %.o: %.c :scanner: scan-gcc-%c
          gcc ...
  
      $(CL_FILES): %.obj: %.c :scanner: scan-cl-%c
          cl ...
>>
  
  Explicit `:scanner:' scanner specification may also be used to state
that a single `.SCANNER' rule should be used to generate dependencies
for more than one target. For example,
<<
      .SCANNER: scan-all-c: $(GCC_FILES) :value:
$(digest-in-path-optional $(INCLUDES), $&)
          gcc -MM $(addprefix -I, $(INCLUDES)) $(GCC_FILES)
  
      $(GCC_FILES): %.o: %.c :scanner: scan-all-c
          ...
>>
  
  The above has the advantage of only running gcc once and a
disadvantage that when a single source file changes, all the files will
end up being re-scanned.
  

7.8  Notes
*=*=*=*=*=

  
  In most cases, you won't need to define scanners of your own. The
standard installation includes default scanners (both explicitly and
implicitly named ones) for C, OCaml, and LaTeX files.
  The `SCANNER_MODE' variable (see Section 12.3.1.7) controls the usage
of implicit scanner dependencies.
  The explicit `:scanner:' dependencies reduce the chances of scanner
mis-specifications. In large complicated projects it might be a good
idea to set `SCANNER_MODE' to `error' and use only the named `.SCANNER'
rules and explicit `:scanner:' specifications.
  

7.9  .DEFAULT
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  The `.DEFAULT' target specifies a target to be built by default if
omake is run without explicit targets. The following rule instructs
omake to build the program `hello' by default
<<
     .DEFAULT: hello
>>
  
  

7.10  .SUBDIRS
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  The `.SUBDIRS' target is used to specify a set of subdirectories that
are part of the project. Each subdirectory should have its own
OMakefile, which is evaluated in the context of the current environment.
<<
     .SUBDIRS: src doc tests
>>
  
  This rule specifies that the `OMakefile's in each of the `src', `doc',
and `tests' directories should be read.
  In some cases, especially when the `OMakefile's are very similar in a
large number of subdirectories, it is inconvenient to have a separate
`OMakefile' for each directory. If the `.SUBDIRS' rule has a body, the
body is used instead of the `OMakefile'.
<<
     .SUBDIRS: src1 src2 src3
        println(Subdirectory $(CWD))
        .DEFAULT: lib.a
>>
  
  In this case, the `src1', `src2', and `src3' files do not need
`OMakefile's. Furthermore, if one exists, it is ignored. The following
includes the file if it exists.
<<
     .SUBDIRS: src1 src2 src3
         if $(file-exists OMakefile)
            include OMakefile
         .DEFAULT: lib.a
>>
  
  

7.11  .INCLUDE
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  The `.INCLUDE' target is like the `include' directive, but it
specifies a rule to build the file if it does not exist.
<<
     .INCLUDE: config
         echo "CONFIG_READ = true" > config
  
      echo CONFIG_READ is $(CONFIG_READ)
>>
  
  You may also specify dependencies to an `.INCLUDE' rule.
<<
     .INCLUDE: config: config.defaults
        cp config.defaults config
>>
  
  A word of caution is in order here. The usual policy is used for
determining when the rule is out-of-date. The rule is executed if any of
the following hold.
  
  
 - the target does not exist, 
 - the rule has never been executed before, 
 - any of the following have changed since the last time the rule was
   executed, 
     
    - the target, 
    - the dependencies, 
    - the commands-text. 
  
  
  In some of the cases, this will mean that the rule is executed even if
the target file already exists. If the target is a file that you expect
to edit by hand (and therefore you don't want to overwrite it), you
should make the rule evaluation conditional on whether the target
already exists.
<<
     .INCLUDE: config: config.defaults
         # Don't overwrite my carefully hand-edited file
         if $(not $(file-exists config))
            cp config.defaults config
>>
  
  

7.12  .PHONY
*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  A ``phony'' target is a target that is not a real file, but exists to
collect a set of dependencies. Phony targets are specified with the
`.PHONY' rule. In the following example, the `install' target does not
correspond to a file, but it corresponds to some commands that should be
run whenever the `install' target is built (for example, by running
`omake install').
<<
     .PHONY: install
  
     install: myprogram.exe
        cp myprogram.exe /usr/bin
>>
  
  

7.13  Rule scoping
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  As we have mentioned before, omake is a scoped language. This provides
great flexibility---different parts of the project can define different
configurations without interfering with one another (for example, one
part of the project might be compiled with `CFLAGS=-O3' and another with
`CFLAGS=-g').
  But how is the scope for a target file selected? Suppose we are
building a file `dir/foo.o'. omake uses the following rules to determine
the scope.
  
  
 - First, if there is an explicit rule for building `dir/foo.o' (a rule
   with no wildcards), the context for that rule determines the scope
   for building the target. 
 - Otherwise, the directory `dir/' must be part of the project. This
   normally means that a configuration file `dir/OMakefile' exists
   (although, see the `.SUBDIRS' section for another way to specify the
   `OMakefile'). In this case, the scope of the target is the scope at
   the end of the `dir/OMakefile'. 
  
  To illustrate rule scoping, let's go back to the example of a ``Hello
world'' program with two files. Here is an example `OMakefile' (the two
definitions of `CFLAGS' are for illustration).
<<
      # The executable is compiled with debugging
      CFLAGS = -g
      hello: hello_code.o hello_lib.o
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $+
  
      # Redefine CFLAGS
      CFLAGS += -O3
>>
  
  In this project, the target `hello' is explicit. The scope of the
`hello' target is the line beginning with `hello:', where the value of
`CFLAGS' is `-g'. The other two targets, `hello_code.o' and
`hello_lib.o' do not appear as explicit targets, so their scope is at
the end of the `OMakefile', where the `CFLAGS' variable is defined to be
`-g -O3'. That is, `hello' will be linked with `CFLAGS=-g' and the `.o'
files will be compiled with `CFLAGS=-g -O3'.
  We can change this behavior for any of the targets by specifying them
as explicit targets. For example, suppose we wish to compile
`hello_lib.o' with a preprocessor variable `LIBRARY'.
<<
      # The executable is compiled with debugging
      CFLAGS = -g
      hello: hello_code.o hello_lib.o
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $+
  
      # Compile hello_lib.o with CFLAGS = -g -DLIBRARY
      section
          CFLAGS += -DLIBRARY
          hello_lib.o:
  
      # Redefine CFLAGS
      CFLAGS += -O3
>>
  
  In this case, `hello_lib.o' is also mentioned as an explicit target,
in a scope where `CFLAGS=-g -DLIBRARY'. Since no rule body is specified,
it is compiled using the usual implicit rule for building `.o' files (in
a context where `CFLAGS=-g -DLIBRARY').
  

7.13.1  Scoping of implicit rules
=================================
  
  Implicit rules (rules containing wildcard patterns) are not global,
they follow the normal scoping convention. This allows different parts
of a project to have different sets of implicit rules. If we like, we
can modify the example above to provide a new implicit rule for building
`hello_lib.o'.
<<
      # The executable is compiled with debugging
      CFLAGS = -g
      hello: hello_code.o hello_lib.o
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $+
  
      # Compile hello_lib.o with CFLAGS = -g -DLIBRARY
      section
          %.o: %.c
              $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -DLIBRARY -c $<
          hello_lib.o:
  
      # Redefine CFLAGS
      CFLAGS += -O3
>>
  
  In this case, the target `hello_lib.o' is built in a scope with a new
implicit rule for building `%.o' files. The implicit rule adds the
`-DLIBRARY' option. This implicit rule is defined only for the target
`hello_lib.o'; the target `hello_code.o' is built as normal.
  

7.13.2  Scoping of .SCANNER rules
=================================
   
  Scanner rules are scoped the same way as normal rules. If the
`.SCANNER' rule is explicit (containing no wildcard patterns), then the
scope of the scan target is the same as the the rule. If the `.SCANNER'
rule is implicit, then the environment is taken from the `:scanner:'
dependency.
<<
      # The executable is compiled with debugging
      CFLAGS = -g
      hello: hello_code.o hello_lib.o
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $+
  
      # scanner for .c files
      .SCANNER: scan-c-%.c: %.c
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -MM $<
  
      # Compile hello_lib.o with CFLAGS = -g -DLIBRARY
      section
          CFLAGS += -DLIBRARY
          hello_lib.o: hello_lib.c :scanner: scan-c-hello_lib.c
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<
  
      # Compile hello_code.c with CFLAGS = -g -O3
      section
          CFLAGS += -O3
          hello_code.o: hello_code.c :scanner: scan-c-hello_code.c
             $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<
>>
  
  Again, this is for illustration---it is unlikely you would need to
write a complicated configuration like this! In this case, the
`.SCANNER' rule specifies that the C-compiler should be called with the
`-MM' flag to compute dependencies. For the target `hello_lib.o', the
scanner is called with `CFLAGS=-g -DLIBRARY', and for `hello_code.o' it
is called with `CFLAGS=-g -O3'.
  

7.13.3  Scoping for .PHONY targets
==================================
   
  Phony targets (targets that do not correspond to files) are defined
with a `.PHONY:' rule. Phony targets are scoped as usual. The following
illustrates a common mistake, where the `.PHONY' target is declared
after it is used.
<<
      # !!This example is broken!!
      all: hello
  
      hello: hello_code.o hello_lib.o
          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $+
  
      .PHONY: all
>>
  
  This doesn't work as expected because the `.PHONY' declaration occurs
too late. The proper way to write this example is to place the `.PHONY'
declaration first.
<<
      # Phony targets must be declared before being used
      .PHONY: all
  
      all: hello
  
      hello: hello_code.o hello_lib.o
          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $+
>>
  
  Phony targets are passed to subdirectories. As a practical matter, it
is wise to declare all `.PHONY' targets in your root `OMakefile', before
any `.SUBDIRS'. This will ensure that 1) they are considered as phony
targets in each of the sbdirectories, and 2) you can build them from the
project root.
<<
      .PHONY: all install clean
  
      .SUBDIRS: src lib clib
>>
  
  

7.14  Pathnames in rules
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  In rules, the targets and dependencies are first translated to file
values (as in the `file' function described in Section 9.1.1). They are
then translated to strings for the command line. This can cause some
unexpected behavior. In the following example, the `absname' function
(Section 9.1.8) is the absolute pathname for the file `a', but the rule
still prints the relative pathname.
<<
      .PHONY: demo
      demo: $(absname a)
          echo $<
  
      # omake demo
      a
>>
  
  There is arguably a good reason for this. On Win32 systems, the `/'
character is viewed as an ``option specifier.'' The pathname separator
is the `\' character. OMake translates the filenames automatically so
that things work as expected on both systems.
<<
     demo: a/b
         echo $<
  
     # omake demo (on a Unix system)
     a/b
     # omake demo (on a Win32 system)
     a\b
>>
  
  Sometimes you may wish that target strings to be passed literally to
the commands in the rule. One way to do this is to specify them
literally.
<<
      SRC = a/b $(absname c/d)
      demo: $(SRC)
          echo $(SRC)
  
      # omake demo (on a Win32 system)
      a/b c:\...\c\d
>>
  
  Alternately, you might wish that filenames be automatically expanded
to absolute pathnames. For example, this might be useful when parsing
the OMake output to look for errors. For this, you can use the
`--absname' option (Section A.3.20). If you call `omake' with the
`--absname' option, all filenames will be exapnded to absolute names.
<<
      # omake --absname demo (on a Unix system)
      /home/.../a/b /home/.../c/d
>>
  
  Alternately, the `--absname' option is scoped. If you want to use it
for only a few rules, you can use the `OMakeFlags' function (see Section
12.2.0.1) to control how it is applied.
<<
     section
        OMakeFlags(--absname)
        demo: a
            echo $<
  
     # omake demo
     /home/.../a
>>
  
  N.B. The `--absname' option is currently an experimental feature.


Chapter 8    Base library
*************************


8.1  Builtin variables
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=



8.1.1  OSTYPE
=============
    Set to the machine architecture omake is running on. Possible values
are  `Unix' (for all Unix versions, including Linux and Mac OS X),
`Win32'  (for MS-Windows, OMake compiled with MSVC++ or Mingw), and
`Cygwin' (for  MS-Windows, OMake compiled with Cygwin).

8.1.2  SYSNAME
==============
    The name of the operating system for the current machine.

8.1.3  NODENAME
===============
    The hostname of the current machine.

8.1.4  OS_VERSION
=================
    The operating system release.

8.1.5  MACHINE
==============
    The machine architecture, e.g. `i386', `sparc', etc.

8.1.6  HOST
===========
    Same as `NODENAME'.

8.1.7  OMAKE_VERSION
====================
    Version of OMake.

8.1.8  USER
===========
    The login name of the user executing the process.

8.1.9  HOME
===========
    The home directory of the user executing the process.

8.1.10  PID
===========
    The OMake process id.

8.1.11  TARGETS
===============
    The command-line target strings. For example, if `omake' is invoked
with the  following command line, 
<<
        omake CFLAGS=1 foo bar.c
>>
  
   then `TARGETS' is defined as `foo bar.c'.
  

8.1.12  BUILD_SUMMARY
=====================
    The `BUILD_SUMMARY' variable refers to the file that `omake' uses 
to summarize a build (the message that is printed at the very end of a
build).  The file is empty when the build starts. If you wish to add
additional messages  to the build summary, you can edit/modify this file
during the build.
  For example, if you want to point out that some action was taken,  you
can append a message to the build summary.
<<
     foo: boo
         echo "The file foo was built" >> $(BUILD_SUMMARY)
         ...build foo...
>>
  

8.2  Logic, Boolean functions, and control flow
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Boolean values in omake are represented by case-insensitive strings.
The false value can be represented by the strings `false', `no', `nil',
`undefined' or `0', and everything else is true.
  

8.2.1  not
==========
  
<<
     $(not e) : String
        e : String
>>
  
  The `not' function negates a Boolean value.
  For example, `$(not false)' expands to the string `true', and `$(not
hello world)' expands to `false'.

8.2.2  equal
============
  
<<
     $(equal e1, e2) : String
        e1 : String
        e2 : String
>>
  
  The `equal' function tests for equality of two values.
  For example `$(equal a, b)' expands to `false', and `$(equal hello
world, hello world)' expands to `true'.

8.2.3  and
==========
  
<<
      $(and e1, ..., en) : String
         e1, ..., en: Sequence
>>
  
  The `and' function evaluates to the conjunction of its arguments.
  For example, in the following code, `X' is true, and `Y' is false.
<<
      A = a
      B = b
      X = $(and $(equal $(A), a) true $(equal $(B), b))
      Y = $(and $(equal $(A), a) true $(equal $(A), $(B)))
>>
  

8.2.4  or
=========
  
<<
     $(or e1, ..., en) : String
        e1, ..., en: String Sequence
>>
  
  The `or' function evaluates to the disjunction of its arguments.
  For example, in the following code, `X' is true, and `Y' is false.
<<
      A = a
      B = b
      X = $(or $(equal $(A), a) false $(equal $(A), $(B)))
      Y = $(or $(equal $(A), $(B)) $(equal $(A), b))
>>
  

8.2.5  if
=========
  
<<
      $(if e1, e2[, e3]) : value
         e1 : String
         e2, e3 : value
>>
  
  The `if' function represents a conditional based on a Boolean value.
For example `$(if $(equal a, b), c, d)' evaluates to `d'.
  Conditionals may also be declared with an alternate syntax.
<<
     if e1
        body1
     elseif e2
        body2
     ...
     else
        bodyn
>>
  
  If the expression `e1' is not false, then the expressions in `body1'
are evaluated and the result is returned as the value of the
conditional. Otherwise, if `e1' evaluates to false, the evaluation
continues with the `e2' expression. If none of the conditional
expressions is true, then the expressions in `bodyn' are evaluated and
the result is returned as the value of the conditional.
  There can be any number of `elseif' clauses; the `else' clause is
optional.
  Note that each branch of the conditional defines its own scope, so
variables defined in the branches are normally not visible outside the
conditional. The `export' command may be used to export the variables
defined in a scope. For example, the following expression represents a
common idiom for defining the C compiler configuration.
<<
     if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
        CC = cl
        CFLAGS += /DWIN32
        export
     else
        CC = gcc
        CFLAGS += -g -O2
        export
>>
  

8.2.6  switch, match
====================
  
  The `switch' and `match' functions perform pattern matching.
  `$(switch <arg>, <pattern_1>, <value_1>, ..., <pattern_n>, <value_n>)'
`$(match <arg>, <pattern_1>, <value_1>, ..., <pattern_n>, <value_n>)'
  The number of `<pattern>/<value>' pairs is arbitrary. They strictly
alternate; the total number of arguments to `<match>' must be odd.
  The `<arg>' is evaluated to a string, and compared with `<pattern_1>'.
If it matches, the result of the expression is `<value_1>'. Otherwise
evaluation continues with the remaining patterns until a match is found.
If no pattern matches, the value is the empty string.
  The `switch' function uses string comparison to compare the argument
with the patterns. For example, the following expression defines the
`FILE' variable to be either `foo', `bar', or the empty string,
depending on the value of the `OSTYPE' variable.
<<
      FILE = $(switch $(OSTYPE), Win32, foo, Unix, bar)
>>
  
  The `match' function uses regular expression patterns (see the `grep'
function). If a match is found, the variables `$1, $2, ...' are bound to
the substrings matched between `\(' and `\)' delimiters. The `$0'
variable contains the entire match, and `$*' is an array of the matched
substrings. to the matched substrings.
<<
      FILE = $(match foo_xyz/bar.a, foo_\\\(.*\\\)/\\\(.*\\\)\.a,
foo_$2/$1.o)
>>
  
  The `switch' and `match' functions also have an alternate (more
usable) form.
<<
     match e
     case pattern1
        body1
     case pattern2
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  If the value of expression `e' matches `pattern_i' and no previous
pattern, then `body_i' is evaluated and returned as the result of the
`match'. The `switch' function uses string comparison; the `match'
function uses regular expression matching.
<<
     match $(FILE)
     case $".*\(\.[^\/.]*\)"
        println(The string $(FILE) has suffix $1)
     default
        println(The string $(FILE) has no suffix)
>>
  

8.2.7  try
==========
  
<<
     try
        try-body
     catch class1(v1)
        catch-body
     when expr
        when-body
     ...
     finally
        finally-body
>>
  
  The `try' form is used for exception handling. First, the expressions
in the `try-body' are evaluated.
  If evaluation results in a value `v' without raising an exception,
then the expressions in the `finally-body' are evaluated and the value
`v' is returned as the result.
  If evaluation of the `try-body' results in a exception object `obj',
the `catch' clauses are examined in order. When examining `catch' clause
`catch class(v)', if the exception object `obj' is an instance of the
class name `class', the variable `v' is bound to the exception object,
and the expressions in the `catch-body' are evaluated.
  If a `when' clause is encountered while a `catch' body is being
evaluated, the predicate `expr' is evaluated. If the result is true,
evaluation continues with the expressions in the `when-body'. Otherwise,
the next `catch' clause is considered for evaluation.
  If evaluation of a `catch-body' or `when-body' completes successfully,
returning a value `v', without encountering another `when' clause, then
the expressions in the `finally-body' are evaluated and the value `v' is
returned as the result.
  There can be any number of `catch' clauses; the `finally' clause is
optional.

8.2.8  raise
============
  
<<
     raise exn
        exn : Exception
>>
  
  The `raise' function raises an exception. The `exn' object can be any
object. However, the normal convention is to raise an `Exception' object
(Section 11.1.20).
  If the exception is never caught, the whole object will be verbosely
printed in the error message. However, if the object is an `Exception'
one and contains a `message' field, only that field will be included in
the error message.

8.2.9  exit
===========
  
<<
     exit(code)
        code : Int
>>
  
  The `exit' function terminates omake abnormally.
  `$(exit <code>)'
  The `exit' function takes one integer argument, which is exit code.
Non-zero values indicate abnormal termination.

8.2.10  defined
===============
  
<<
     $(defined sequence) : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `defined' function test whether all the variables in the sequence
are currently defined. For example, the following code defines the `X'
variable if it is not already defined.
<<
      if $(not $(defined X))
         X = a b c
         export
>>
  

8.2.11  defined-env
===================
  
<<
     $(defined-env sequence) : String
        sequence : String
>>
  
  The `defined-env' function tests whether a variable is defined as part
of the process environment.
  For example, the following code adds the `-g' compile option if the
environment variable `DEBUG' is defined.
<<
  if $(defined-env DEBUG)
      CFLAGS += -g
      export
>>
  

8.2.12  getenv
==============
  
<<
     $(getenv name) : String
     $(getenv name, default) : String
>>
  
  The `getenv' function gets the value of a variable from the process
environment. The function takes one or two arguments.
  In the single argument form, an exception is raised if the variable
variable is not defined in the environment. In the two-argument form,
the second argument is returned as the result if the value is not
defined.
  For example, the following code defines the variable `X' to be a
space-separated list of elements of the `PATH' environment variable if
it is defined, and to `/bin /usr/bin' otherwise.
<<
      X = $(split $(PATHSEP), $(getenv PATH, /bin:/usr/bin))
>>
  
  You may also use the alternate form. 
<<
       getenv(NAME)
           default
>>
  

8.2.13  setenv
==============
  
<<
     setenv(name, value)
        name : String
        value : String
>>
  
  The `setenv' function sets the value of a variable in the process
environment. Environment variables are scoped like normal variables.
  

8.2.14  unsetenv
================
  
<<
     unsetenv(names)
        names : String Array
>>
  
  The `unsetenv' function removes some variable definitions from the
process environment. Environment variables are scoped like normal
variables.
  

8.2.15  get-registry
====================
  
<<
     get-registry(hkey, key, field) : String
     get-registry(hkey, key, field, default) : String
         hkey : String
         key : String
         field : String
>>
  
  The `get-registry' function retrieves a string value from the system
registry on Win32. On other architectures, there is no registry.
  The `hive' (I think that is the right word), indicates which part of
the registry to use. It should be one of the following values.
  
  
 - `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT' 
 - `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG' 
 - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER' 
 - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE' 
 - `HKEY_USERS' 
   Refer to the Microsoft documentation if you want to know what these
mean.
  The `key' is the field you want to get from the registry. It should
have a form like `A\B\C' (if you use forward slashes, they will be
converted to backslashes). The field is the sub-field of the key.
  In the 4-argument form, the `default' is returned on failure. You may
also use the alternate form.
<<
      get-registry(hkey, key, field)
         default
>>
  
  

8.2.16  getvar
==============
  
<<
     $(getvar name) : String
>>
  
  The `getvar' function gets the value of a variable.
  An exception is raised if the variable variable is not defined.
  For example, the following code defines X to be the string abc.
<<
      NAME = foo
      foo_1 = abc
      X = $(getvar $(NAME)_1)
>>
  

8.2.17  setvar
==============
  
<<
     setvar(name, value)
        name : String
        value : String
>>
  
  The `setvar' function defines a new variable. For example, the
following code defines the variable `X' to be the string `abc'.
<<
     NAME = X
     setvar($(NAME), abc)
>>
  

8.3  Arrays and sequences
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  

8.3.1  array
============
  
<<
      $(array elements) : Array
         elements : Sequence
>>
  
  The `array' function creates an array from a sequence. If the `<arg>'
is a string, the elements of the array are the whitespace-separated
elements of the string, respecting quotes.
  In addition, array variables can be declared as follows.
<<
      A[] =
         <val1>
         ...
         <valn>
>>
  
  In this case, the elements of the array are exactly `<val1>', ...,
`<valn>', and whitespace is preserved literally.

8.3.2  split
============
  
<<
     $(split sep, elements) : Array
        sep : String
        elements : Sequence
>>
  
  The `split' function takes two arguments, a string of separators, and
a string argument. The result is an array of elements determined by
splitting the elements by all occurrence of the separator in the
`elements' sequence.
  For example, in the following code, the `X' variable is defined to be
the array `/bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin'.
<<
      PATH = /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
      X = $(split :, $(PATH))
>>
  
  The `sep' argument may be omitted. In this case `split' breaks its
arguments along the white space. Quotations are not split.

8.3.3  concat
=============
  
<<
     $(concat sep, elements) : String
        sep : String
        elements : Sequence
>>
  
  The `concat' function takes two arguments, a separator string, and a
sequence of elements. The result is a string formed by concatenating the
elements, placing the separator between adjacent elements.
  For example, in the following code, the `X' variable is defined to be
the string `foo_x_bar_x_baz'.
<<
      X = foo  bar     baz
      Y = $(concat _x_, $(X))
>>
  

8.3.4  length
=============
  
<<
     $(length sequence) : Int
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `length' function returns the number of elements in its argument.
  For example, the expression `$(length a  b "c d")' evaluates to 3.

8.3.5  nth
==========
  
<<
     $(nth i, sequence) : value
        i : Int
        sequence : Sequence
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `nth' function returns the nth element of its argument, treated as
a list. Counting starts at 0. An exception is raised if the index is not
in bounds.
  For example, the expression `$(nth 1, a "b c" d)' evaluates to `"b
c"'.

8.3.6  nth-hd
=============
  
<<
     $(nth-hd i, sequence) : value
        i : Int
        sequence : Sequence
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `nth-hd' function returns the first `i' elements of the sequence.
An exception is raised if the sequence is not at least `i' elements
long.
  For example, the expression `$(nth-hd 2, a "b c" d)' evaluates to `a
"b c"'.
  

8.3.7  nth-tl
=============
  
<<
     $(nth-tl i, sequence) : value
        i : Int
        sequence : Sequence
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `nth-tl' function skips `i' elements of the sequence and returns
the rest. An exception is raised if the sequence is not at least `i'
elements long.
  For example, the expression `$(nth-tl 1, a "b c" d)' evaluates to `"b
c" d'.
  

8.3.8  subrange
===============
  
<<
     $(subrange off, len, sequent) : value
        off : Int
        len : Int
        sequence : Sequence
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `subrange' function returns a subrange of the sequence. Counting
starts at 0. An exception is raised if the specified range is not in
bounds.
  For example, the expression `$(subrange 1, 2, a "b c" d e)' evaluates
to `"b c" d'.

8.3.9  rev
==========
  
<<
      $(rev sequence) : Sequence
         sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `rev' function returns the elements of a sequence in reverse
order. For example, the expression `$(rev a "b c" d)' evaluates to `d "b
c" a'.

8.3.10  string
==============
  
<<
     $(string sequence) : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `string' function flattens a sequence into a single string. This
is similar to the `concat' function, but the elements are separated by
whitespace. The result is treated as a unit; whitespace is significant.

8.3.11  string-escaped
======================


8.3.12  ocaml-escaped
=====================


8.3.13  html-escaped
====================


8.3.14  html-pre-escaped
========================


8.3.15  c-escaped
=================


8.3.16  id-escaped
==================
  
<<
     $(string-escaped sequence) : String Array
     $(ocaml-escaped sequence) : String Array
     $(html-escaped sequence) : String Array
     $(html-pre-escaped sequence) : String Array
     $(c-escaped sequence) : String Array
     $(hex-escaped sequence) : StringArray
        sequence : Array
>>
  
  The `string-escaped' function converts each element of its argument to
a string, escaping characters that are special to omake. The special
characters include `:)(,' and shitespace.
  The `ocaml-escaped' function converts each element of its argument to
a string, escaping characters that are special to OCaml.
  The `c-escaped' function converts a string to a form that can be used
as a string constant in C.
  The `id-escaped' function turns a string into an identifier that may
be used in OMake.
  The `html-escaped' function turns a literal string into a form
acceptable as HTML. The `html-pre-escaped' function is similar, but it
does not translate newlines into `<br>'.
<<
      string-escaped($"a b" $"y:z")
      a\ b y\:z
>>
  

8.3.17  quote
=============
  
<<
     $(quote sequence) : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `quote' function flattens a sequence into a single string and adds
quotes around the string. Inner quotation symbols are escaped.
  For example, the expression `$(quote a "b c" d)' evaluates to `"a \"b
c\" d"', and `$(quote abc)' evaluates to `"abc"'.

8.3.18  quote-argv
==================
  
<<
     $(quote-argv sequence) : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `quote-argv' function flattens a sequence into a single string,
and adds quotes around the string. The quotation is formed so that a
command-line parse can separate the string back into its components.

8.3.19  html-string
===================
  
<<
     $(html-string sequence) : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `html-string' function flattens a sequence into a single string,
and escaped special HTML characters. This is similar to the `concat'
function, but the elements are separated by whitespace. The result is
treated as a unit; whitespace is significant.

8.3.20  addsuffix
=================
  
<<
     $(addsuffix suffix, sequence) : Array
        suffix : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `addsuffix' function adds a suffix to each component of sequence.
The number of elements in the array is exactly the same as the number of
elements in the sequence.
  For example, `$(addsuffix .c, a b "c d")' evaluates to `a.c b.c "c
d".c'.

8.3.21  mapsuffix
=================
  
<<
     $(mapsuffix suffix, sequence) : Array
        suffix : value
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `mapsuffix' function adds a suffix to each component of sequence.
It is similar to `addsuffix', but uses array concatenation instead of
string concatenation. The number of elements in the array is twice the
number of elements in the sequence.
  For example, `$(mapsuffix .c, a b "c d")' evaluates to `a .c b .c "c
d" .c'.

8.3.22  addsuffixes
===================
  
<<
     $(addsuffixes suffixes, sequence) : Array
        suffixes : Sequence
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `addsuffixes' function adds all suffixes in its first argument to
each component of a sequence. If `suffixes' has `n' elements, and
`sequence' has `m' elements, the the result has `n * m' elements.
  For example, the `$(addsuffixes .c .o, a b c)' expressions evaluates
to `a.c a.o b.c b.o c.o c.a'.

8.3.23  removeprefix
====================
  
<<
     $(removeprefix prefix, sequence) : Array
        prefix : String
        sequence : Array
>>
  
  The `removeprefix' function removes a prefix from each component of a
sequence.

8.3.24  removesuffix
====================
  
<<
     $(removesuffix sequence) : Array
        sequence : String
>>
  
  The `removesuffix' function removes the suffixes from each component
of a sequence.
  For example, `$(removesuffix a.c b.foo "c d")' expands to `a b "c d"'.


8.3.25  replacesuffixes
=======================
  
<<
     $(replacesuffixes old-suffixes, new-suffixes, sequence) : Array
        old-suffixes : Sequence
        new-suffixes : Sequence
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `replacesuffixes' function modifies the suffix of each component
in sequence. The `old-suffixes' and `new-suffixes' sequences should have
the same length.
  For example, `$(replacesuffixes, .h .c, .o .o, a.c b.h c.z)' expands
to `a.o b.o c.z'.

8.3.26  addprefix
=================
  
<<
     $(addprefix prefix, sequence) : Array
        prefix : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `addprefix' function adds a prefix to each component of a
sequence. The number of element in the result array is exactly the same
as the number of elements in the argument sequence.
  For example, `$(addprefix foo/, a b "c d")' evaluates to `foo/a foo/b
foo/"c d"'.

8.3.27  mapprefix
=================
  
<<
     $(mapprefix prefix, sequence) : Array
        prefix : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `mapprefix' function adds a prefix to each component of a
sequence. It is similar to `addprefix', but array concatenation is used
instead of string concatenation. The result array contains twice as many
elements as the argument sequence.
  For example, `$(mapprefix foo, a b "c d")' expands to `foo a foo b foo
"c d"'.

8.3.28  add-wrapper
===================
  
<<
     $(add-wrapper prefix, suffix, sequence) : Array
        prefix : String
        suffix : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `add-wrapper' functions adds both a prefix and a suffix to each
component of a sequence. For example, the expression `$(add-wrapper
dir/, .c, a b)' evaluates to `dir/a.c dir/b.c'. String concatenation is
used. The array result has the same number of elements as the argument
sequence.

8.3.29  set
===========
  
<<
     $(set sequence) : Array
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `set' function sorts a set of string components, eliminating
duplicates.
  For example, `$(set z y z "m n" w a)' expands to `"m n" a w y z'.

8.3.30  mem
===========
  
<<
     $(mem elem, sequence) : Boolean
        elem : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `mem' function tests for membership in a sequence.
  For example, `$(mem "m n", y z "m n" w a)' evaluates to `true', while
`$(mem m n, y z "m n" w a)' evaluates to `false'.

8.3.31  intersection
====================
  
<<
     $(intersection sequence1, sequence2) : Array
        sequence1 : Sequence
        sequence2 : Sequence
>>
  
  The `intersection' function takes two arguments, treats them as sets
of strings, and computes their intersection. The order of the result is
undefined, and it may contain duplicates. Use the `set' function to sort
the result and eliminate duplicates in the result if desired.
  For example, the expression `$(intersection c a b a, b a)' evaluates
to `a b a'.

8.3.32  intersects
==================
  
<<
     $(intersects sequence1, sequence2) : Boolean
        sequence1 : Sequence
        sequence2 : Sequence
>>
  
  The `intersects' function tests whether two sets have a non-empty
intersection. This is slightly more efficient than computing the
intersection and testing whether it is empty.
  For example, the expression `$(intersects a b c, d c e)' evaluates to
`true', and `$(intersects a b c a, d e f)' evaluates to `false'.

8.3.33  set-diff
================
  
<<
     $(set-diff sequence1, sequence2) : Array
        sequence1 : Sequence
        sequence2 : Sequence
>>
  
  The `set-diff' function takes two arguments, treats them as sets of
strings, and computes their difference (all the elements of the first
set that are not present in the second one). The order of the result is
undefined and it may contain duplicates. Use the `set' function to sort
the result and eliminate duplicates in the result if desired.
  For example, the expression `$(set-diff c a b a e, b a)' evaluates to
`c e'.

8.3.34  filter
==============
  
<<
     $(filter patterns, sequence) : Array
        patterns : Sequence
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `filter' function picks elements from a sequence. The patterns is
a non-empty sequence of patterns, each may contain one occurrence of the
wildcard `%' character.
  For example `$(filter %.h %.o, a.c x.o b.h y.o "hello world".c)'
evaluates to `x.o b.h y.o'.

8.3.35  filter-out
==================
  
<<
     $(filter-out patterns, sequence) : Array
        patterns : Sequence
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `filter-out' function removes elements from a sequence. The
patterns is a non-empty sequence of patterns, each may contain one
occurrence of the wildcard `%' character.
  For example `$(filter-out %.c %.h, a.c x.o b.h y.o "hello world".c)'
evaluates to `x.o y.o'.

8.3.36  capitalize
==================
  
<<
     $(capitalize sequence) : Array
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `capitalize' function capitalizes each word in a sequence. For
example, `$(capitalize through the looking Glass)' evaluates to `Through
The Looking Glass'.

8.3.37  uncapitalize
====================
  
<<
     $(uncapitalize sequence) : Array
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `uncapitalize' function uncapitalizes each word in its argument.
  For example, `$(uncapitalize through the looking Glass)' evaluates to
`through the looking glass'.

8.3.38  uppercase
=================
  
<<
     $(uppercase sequence) : Array
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `uppercase' function converts each word in a sequence to
uppercase. For example, `$(uppercase through the looking Glass)'
evaluates to `THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS'.

8.3.39  lowercase
=================
  
<<
     $(lowercase sequence) : Array
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `lowercase' function reduces each word in its argument to
lowercase.
  For example, `$(lowercase through tHe looking Glass)' evaluates to
`through the looking glass'.

8.3.40  system
==============
  
<<
     system(s)
        s : Sequence
>>
  
  The `system' function is used to evaluate a shell expression. This
function is used internally by omake to evaluate shell commands.
  For example, the following program is equivalent to the expression
`system(ls foo)'.
<<
     ls foo
>>
  

8.3.41  shell
=============
  
<<
     $(shell command) : Array
     $(shella command) : Array
     $(shell-code command) : Int
        command : Sequence
>>
  
  The `shell' function evaluates a command using the command shell, and
returns the whitespace-separated words of the standard output as the
result.
  The `shella' function acts similarly, but it returns the lines as
separate items in the array.
  The `shell-code' function returns the exit code. The output is not
diverted.
  For example, if the current directory contains the files `OMakeroot',
`OMakefile', and `hello.c', then `$(shell ls)' evaluates to `hello.c
OMakefile OMakeroot' (on a Unix system).

8.3.42  while
=============
  
<<
     while <test>
        <body>
>>
  
  --or--
<<
      while <test>
      case <test1>
         <body1>
      ...
      case <testn>
         <bodyn>
      default
         <bodyd>
>>
  
  The loop is executed while the test is true. In the first form, the
`<body>' is executed on every loop iteration. In the second form, the
body `<bodyI>' is selected, as the first case where the test `<testI>'
is true. If none apply, the optional default case is evaluated. If no
cases are true, the loop exits. The environment is automatically
exported.
  Examples.
  Iterate for `i' from `0' to `9'.
<<
      i = 0
      while $(lt $i, 10)
         echo $i
         i = $(add $i, 1)
>>
  
  The following example is equivalent.
<<
     i = 0
     while true
     case $(lt $i, 10)
        echo $i
        i = $(add $i, 1)
>>
  
  The following example is similar, but some special cases are printed.
value is printed.
<<
      i = 0
      while $(lt $i, 10)
      case $(equal $i, 0)
         echo zero
      case $(equal $i, 1)
         echo one
      default
         echo $i
>>
  
  The `break' function (Section 8.3.43) can be used to break out of the
`while' loop early.

8.3.43  break
=============
  
<<
     break
>>
  
  Terminate execution of the innermost loop, returning the current
state.

8.4  Arithmetic
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*



8.4.1  int
==========
  
  The `int' function can be used to create integers. It returns an `Int'
object.
  `$(int 17)'.
  

8.4.2  float
============
   The `float' function can be used to create floating-point numbers. It
returns a `Float' object.
  `$(float 3.1415926)'.

8.4.3  Basic arithmetic
=======================
               
  The following functions can be used to perform basic arithmetic.
  
  
 - `$(neg <numbers>)': arithmetic inverse 
 - `$(add <numbers>)': addition. 
 - `$(sub <numbers>)': subtraction. 
 - `$(mul <numbers>)': multiplication. 
 - `$(div <numbers>)': division. 
 - `$(mod <numbers>)': remainder. 
 - `$(lnot <numbers>)': bitwise inverse. 
 - `$(land <numbers>)': bitwise and. 
 - `$(lor <numbers>)': bitwise or. 
 - `$(lxor <numbers>)': bitwise exclusive-or. 
 - `$(lsl <numbers>)': logical shift left. 
 - `$(lsr <numbers>)': logical shift right. 
 - `$(asr <numbers>)': arithmetic shift right. 


8.4.4  Comparisons
==================
           
  The following functions can be used to perform numerical comparisons.
  
  
 - `$(lt <numbers>)': less then. 
 - `$(le <numbers>)': no more than. 
 - `$(eq <numbers>)': equal. 
 - `$(ge <numbers>)': no less than. 
 - `$(gt <numbers>)': greater than. 
 - `$(ult <numbers>)': unsigned less than. 
 - `$(ule <numbers>)': unsigned greater than. 
 - `$(uge <numbers>)': unsigned greater than or equal. 
 - `$(ugt <numbers>)': unsigned greater than. 


8.5  First-class functions
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=



8.5.1  fun
==========
  
  The `fun' form introduces anonymous functions.
  `$(fun <v1>, ..., <vn>, <body>)'
  The last argument is the body of the function. The other arguments are
the parameter names.
  The three following definitions are equivalent.
<<
      F(X, Y) =
         return($(addsuffix $(Y), $(X)))
  
      F = $(fun X, Y, $(addsuffix $(Y), $(X)))
  
      F =
         fun(X, Y)
            value $(addsuffix $(Y), $(X))
>>
  

8.5.2  apply
============
  
  The `apply' operator is used to apply a function.
  `$(apply <fun>, <args>)'
  Suppose we have the following function definition.
<<
      F(X, Y) =
         return($(addsuffix $(Y), $(X)))
>>
  
  The the two expressions below are equivalent.
<<
      X = F(a b c, .c)
      X = $(apply $(F), a b c, .c)
>>
  

8.5.3  applya
=============
  
  The `applya' operator is used to apply a function to an array of
arguments.
  `$(applya <fun>, <args>)'
  For example, in the following program, the value of `Z' is `file.c'.
<<
      F(X, Y) =
         return($(addsuffix $(Y), $(X)))
      args[] =
         file
         .c
      Z = $(applya $(F), $(args))
>>
  

8.5.4  create-map, create-lazy-map
==================================
  
  The `create-map' is a simplified form for creating `Map' objects. The
`create-map' function takes an even number of arguments that specify
key/value pairs. For example, the following values are equivalent.
<<
      X = $(create-map name1, xxx, name2, yyy)
  
      X. =
          extends $(Map)
          $|name1| = xxx
          $|name2| = yyy
>>
  
  The `create-lazy-map' function is similar, but the values are computed
lazily. The following two definitions are equivalent.
<<
      Y = $(create-lazy-map name1, $(xxx), name2, $(yyy))
  
      Y. =
          extends $(Map)
          $|name1| = $`(xxx)
          $|name2| = $`(yyy)
>>
  
  The `create-lazy-map' function (see Section 12.8.0.11) is used in rule
construction.

8.6  Iteration and mapping
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  

8.6.1  foreach
==============
  
  The `foreach' function maps a function over a sequence.
<<
      $(foreach <fun>, <args>)
  
      foreach(<var>, <args>)
         <body>
>>
  
  For example, the following program defines the variable `X' as an
array `a.c b.c c.c'.
<<
      X =
         foreach(x, a b c)
            value $(x).c
  
      # Equivalent expression
      X = $(foreach $(fun x, $(x).c), abc)
>>
  
  There is also an abbreviated syntax.
  The `export' form can also be used in a `foreach' body. The final
value of `X' is `a.c b.c c.c'.
<<
      X =
      foreach(x, a b c)
         X += $(x).c
         export
>>
  
  The `break' function (Section 8.3.43) can be used to break out of the
loop early.

Chapter 9    File operations
****************************


9.1  File names
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*



9.1.1  file, dir
================
  
<<
     $(file sequence) : File Sequence
        sequence : Sequence
     $(dir sequence) : Dir Sequence
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `file' and `dir' functions define location-independent references
to files and directories. In omake, the commands to build a target are
executed in the target's directory. Since there may be many directories
in an omake project, the build system provides a way to construct a
reference to a file in one directory, and use it in another without
explicitly modifying the file name. The functions have the following
syntax, where the name should refer to a file or directory.
  For example, we can construct a reference to a file `foo' in the
current directory.
<<
     FOO = $(file foo)
     .SUBDIRS: bar
>>
  
  If the `FOO' variable is expanded in the `bar' subdirectory, it will
expand to `../foo'.
  These commands are often used in the top-level OMakefile to provide
location-independent references to top-level directories, so that build
commands may refer to these directories as if they were absolute.
<<
     ROOT = $(dir .)
     LIB  = $(dir lib)
     BIN  = $(dir bin)
>>
  
  Once these variables are defined, they can be used in build commands
in subdirectories as follows, where `$(BIN)' will expand to the location
of the `bin' directory relative to the command being executed.
<<
     install: hello
   cp hello $(BIN)
>>
  

9.1.2  tmpfile
==============
  
<<
      $(tmpfile prefix) : File
      $(tmpfile prefix, suffix) : File
          prefix : String
          suffix : String
>>
  
  The `tmpfile' function returns the name of a fresh temporary file in
the temporary directory.

9.1.3  in
=========
  
<<
     $(in dir, exp) : String Array
        dir : Dir
        exp : expression
>>
  
  The `in' function is closely related to the `dir' and `file'
functions. It takes a directory and an expression, and evaluates the
expression in that effective directory. For example, one common way to
install a file is to define a symbol link, where the value of the link
is relative to the directory where the link is created.
  The following commands create links in the `$(LIB)' directory.
<<
      FOO = $(file foo)
      install:
         ln -s $(in $(LIB), $(FOO)) $(LIB)/foo
>>
  
  Note that the `in' function only affects the expansion of `Node'
(`File' and `Dir') values.

9.1.4  basename
===============
  
<<
     $(basename files) : String Sequence
        files : String Sequence
>>
  
  The `basename' function returns the base names for a list of files.
The basename is the filename with any leading directory components
removed.
  For example, the expression `$(basename dir1/dir2/a.out
/etc/modules.conf /foo.ml)' evaluates to `a.out modules.conf foo.ml'.

9.1.5  rootname
===============
  
<<
     $(rootname files) : String Sequence
        files : String Sequence
>>
  
  The `rootname' function returns the root name for a list of files. The
rootname is the filename with the final suffix removed.
  For example, the expression `$(rootname dir1/dir2/a.out /etc/a.b.c
/foo.ml)' evaluates to `dir1/dir2/a /etc/a.b /foo'.

9.1.6  dirof
============
  
<<
     $(dirof files) : Dir Sequence
        files : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `dirof' function returns the directory for each of the listed
files.
  For example, the expression `$(dirof dir/dir2/a.out /etc/modules.conf
/foo.ml)' evaluates to the directories `dir1/dir2 /etc /'.

9.1.7  fullname
===============
  
<<
     $(fullname files) : String Sequence
        files : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `fullname' function returns the pathname relative to the project
root for each of the files or directories.

9.1.8  absname
==============
  
<<
     $(absname files) : String Sequence
        files : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `absname' function returns the absolute pathname for each of the
files or directories.

9.1.9  homename
===============
  
<<
     $(homename files) : String Sequence
        files : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `homename' function returns the name of a file in tilde form, if
possible. The unexpanded forms are computed lazily: the `homename'
function will usually evaluate to an absolute pathname until the first
tilde-expansion for the same directory.

9.1.10  suffix
==============
  
<<
     $(suffix files) : String Sequence
        files : StringSequence
>>
  
  The `suffix' function returns the suffixes for a list of files. If a
file has no suffix, the function returns the empty string.
  For example, the expression `$(suffix dir1/dir2/a.out /etc/a /foo.ml)'
evaluates to `.out .ml'.

9.2  Path search
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=



9.2.1  which
============
  
<<
     $(which files) : File Sequence
        files : String Sequence
>>
  
  The `which' function searches for executables in the current command
search path, and returns `file' values for each of the commands. It is
an error if a command is not found.

9.2.2  where
============
  
  The `where' function is similar to which, except it returns the list
of all the locations of the given executable (in the order in which the
corresponding directories appear in `$PATH'). In case a command is
handled internally by the `Shell' object, the first string in the output
will describe the command as a built-in function.
<<
      % where echo
      echo is a Shell object method (a built-in function)
      /bin/echo
>>
  

9.2.3  rehash
=============
  
<<
      rehash()
>>
  
  The `rehash' function resets all search paths.

9.2.4  exists-in-path
=====================
  
<<
     $(exists-in-path files) : String
        files : String Sequence
>>
  
  The `exists-in-path' function tests whether all executables are
present in the current search path.

9.2.5  digest
=============
  
<<
       $(digest files) : String Array
          file : File Array
       raises RuntimeException
  
       $(digest-optional files) : String Array
          file : File Array
>>
  
  The `digest' and `digest-optional' functions compute MD5 digests of
files. The `digest' function raises an exception if a file does no
exist. The `digest-optional' returns `false' if a file does no exist.
MD5 digests are cached.

9.2.6  find-in-path
===================
  
<<
      $(find-in-path path, files) : File Array
         path : Dir Array
         files : String Array
      raises RuntimeException
  
      $(find-in-path-optional path, files) : File Array
>>
  
  The `find-in-path' function searches for the files in a search path.
Only the tail of the filename is significant. The `find-in-path'
function raises an exception if the file can't be found. The
`find-in-path-optional' function silently removes files that can't be
found.

9.2.7  digest-path
==================
  
<<
      $(digest-in-path path, files) : String/File Array
         path : Dir Array
         files : String Array
      raises RuntimeException
  
      $(digest-in-path-optional path, files) : String/File Array
>>
  
  The `digest-in-path' function searches for the files in a search path
and returns the file and digest for each file. Only the tail of the
filename is significant. The `digest-in-path' function raises an
exception if the file can't be found. The `digest-in-path-optional'
function silently removes elements that can't be found.

9.3  File stats
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*



9.3.1  file-exists, target-exists, target-is-proper
===================================================
  
<<
     $(file-exists files) : String
     $(target-exists files) : String
     $(target-is-proper files) : String
         files : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `file-exists' function checks whether the files listed exist. The
`target-exists' function is similar to the `file-exists' function.
However, it returns true if the file exists or if it can be built by the
current project. The `target-is-proper' returns true only if the file
can be generated in the current project.

9.3.2  stat-reset
=================
  
<<
     $(stat-reset files) : String
         files : File Sequence
>>
  
  OMake uses a stat-cache. The `stat-reset' function reset the `stat'
information for the given files, forcing the `stat' information to be
recomputed the next time it is requested.

9.3.3  filter-exists, filter-targets, filter-proper-targets
===========================================================
  
<<
     $(filter-exists files) : File Sequence
     $(filter-targets files) : File Sequence
     $(filter-proper-targets) : File Sequence
        files : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `filter-exists', `filter-targets', and `filter-proper-targets'
functions remove files from a list of files. 
  
 - `filter-exists': the result is the list of files that exist. 
 - `filter-targets': the result is the list of files either exist, or 
   can be built by the current project. 
 - `filter-proper-targets': the result is the list of files that can  be
   built in the current project. 
  
  One way to create a simple ``clean'' rule that removes generated files
from the project is by removing all files that can be built in the
current project. CAUTION: you should be careful before you do this. The
rule removes any file that can potentially be reconstructed. There is no
check to make sure that the commands to rebuild the file would actually
succeed. Also, note that no file outside the current project will be
deleted.
<<
      .PHONY: clean
  
      clean:
          rm $(filter-proper-targets $(ls R, .))
>>
  
  See the `dependencies-proper' function to see an alternate method for
removing intermediate files.
  If you use CVS, you may wish to use the `cvs_realclean' program that
is distributed with `omake'.
  

9.3.4  find-targets-in-path, find-targets-in-path-optional
==========================================================
  
<<
      $(find-targets-in-path path files) : File Array
      $(find-targets-in-path-optional path, files) : File Array
          path : Dir Array
          files : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `find-target-in-path' function searches for targets in the search
path. For each file `file' in the file list, the path is searched
sequentially for a directory `dir' such that the target `dir/file'
exists. If so, the file `dir/file' is returned.
  For example, suppose you are building a C project, and project
contains a subdirectory `src/' containing only the files `fee.c' and
`foo.c'. The following expression evaluates to the files `src/fee.o'
`src/foo.o' even if the files have not already been built.
<<
      $(find-targets-in-path lib src, fee.o foo.o)
  
      # Evaluates to
      src/fee.o src/foo.o
>>
  
  The `find-targets-in-path' function raises an exception if the file
can't be found. The `find-targets-in-path-optional' function silently
removes targets that can't be found.
<<
      $(find-targets-in-path-optional lib src, fee.o foo.o fum.o)
  
      # Evaluates to
      src/fee.o src/foo.o
>>
  

9.3.5  file-sort
================
    
<<
     $(file-sort order, files) : File Sequence
        order : String
        files : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `file-sort' function sorts a list of filenames by build order
augmented by a set of sort rules. Sort rules are declared using the
`.ORDER' target. The `.BUILDORDER' defines the default order.
  `$(file-sort <order>, <files>)'
  For example, suppose we have the following set of rules.
<<
     a: b c
     b: d
     c: d
  
     .DEFAULT: a b c d
        echo $(file-sort .BUILDORDER, a b c d)
>>
  
  In the case, the sorter produces the result `d b c a'. That is, a
target is sorted after its dependencies. The sorter is frequently used
to sort files that are to be linked by their dependencies (for languages
where this matters).
  There are three important restrictions to the sorter: 
  
 - The sorter can be used only within a rule body. The reason for this
   is that all dependencies must be known before the sort is performed. 
 - The sorter can only sort files that are buildable in the current
   project. 
 - The sorter will fail if the dependencies are cyclic. 
  
  

9.3.5.1  sort rule
------------------
  
  It is possible to further constrain the sorter through the use of sort
rules. A sort rule is declared in two steps. The target must be listed
as an `.ORDER' target; and then a set of sort rules must be given. A
sort rule defines a pattern constraint.
<<
     .ORDER: .MYORDER
  
     .MYORDER: %.foo: %.bar
     .MYORDER: %.bar: %.baz
  
     .DEFAULT: a.foo b.bar c.baz d.baz
        echo $(sort .MYORDER, a.foo b.bar c.baz d.baz)
>>
  
  In this example, the `.MYORDER' sort rule specifies that any file with
a suffix `.foo' should be placed after any file with suffix `.bar', and
any file with suffix `.bar' should be placed after a file with suffix
`.baz'.
  In this example, the result of the sort is `d.baz c.baz b.bar a.foo'.

9.3.6  file-check-sort
======================
  
<<
     file-check-sort(files)
        files : File Sequence
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `file-check-sort' function checks whether a list of files is in
sort order. If so, the list is returned unchanged. If not, the function
raises an exception.
  `$(file-check-sort <order>, <files>)'

9.4  Globbing and file listings
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  OMake commands are ``glob-expanded'' before being executed. That is,
names may contain patterns that are expanded to sequences of file and
directory names. The syntax follows the standard bash(1), csh(1),
syntax, with the following rules.
  
  
 - A pathname is a sequence of directory and file names separated by one
   of the `/' or `\' characters. For example, the following pathnames
   refer to the same file: `/home/jyh/OMakefile' and
   `/home\jyh/OMakefile'.
 
 - Glob-expansion is performed on the components of a path. If a path
   contains occurrences of special characters (listed below), the path
   is viewed as a pattern to be matched against the actual files in the
   system. The expansion produces a sequence of all file/directory names
   that match.
 For the following examples, suppose that a directory `/dir' contains
   files named `a', `-a', `a.b', and `b.c'.
 
     
    *  Matches any sequence of zero-or-more characters. For example, the
      pattern `/dir/a*' expands to `/dir/a /dir/aa /dir/a.b'.
    
    ?  Matches exactly one character. The pattern `/dir/?a' expands the
      filename `/dir/-a'.
    
    [...]  Square brackets denote character sets and ranges in the ASCII
      character set. The pattern may contain individual characters c or
      character ranges c_1-c_2. The pattern matches any of the
      individual characters specified, or any characters in the range. A
      leading ``hat'' inverts the send of the pattern. To specify a
      pattern that contains the literal characters `-', the `-' should
      occur as the first character in the range.
                                        
              Pattern        Expansion                          
             ---------------------------------------------------
              `/dir/[a-b]*'  `/dir/a /dir/a.b /dir/b.c'         
              `/dir/[-a-b]*' `/dir/a /dir/-a /dir/a.b /dir/b.c' 
              `/dir/[-a]*'   `/dir/a /dir/-a /dir/a.b'          
                                        
    
    
    {s1,...,sN}  Braces indicate brace-expansion. The braces delimit a
      sequence of strings separated by commas. Given N strings, the
      result produces N copies of the pattern, one for each of the
      strings s_i.
                                        
                      Pattern           Expansion        
                     ------------------------------------
                      `a{b,c,d}'        `ab ac ad'       
                      `a{b{c,d},e}'     `abc abd ae'     
                      `a{?{[A-Z],d},*}' `a?[A-Z] a?d a*' 
                                        
    
    
       The tilde is used to specify home directories. Depending on your
      system, these might be possible expansions.
                                        
               Pattern    Expansion                             
              --------------------------------------------------
               `~jyh'     `/home/jyh'                           
               `~bob/*.c' `c:\Documents and Settings\users\bob' 
                                        
    
    
    
      The `\' character is both a pathname separator and an escape
      character. If followed by a special glob character, the `\'
      changes the sense of the following character to non-special
      status. Otherwise, `\' is viewed as a pathname separator.
                                        
       Pattern                  Expansion                               
                                           
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  ---------
       `~jyh/\*'                `~jyh/*' (`*' is literal)               
                                           
        `/dir/\[a-z?'            `/dir/[a-z?' (`[' is literal, `?' is a
                                  pattern). 
       `c:\Program Files\[A-z]' `c:\Program Files[A-z]*'                
                                           
                                        
    
    Note that the final case might be considered to be ambiguous (where
      `\' should be viewed as a pathname separator, not as an escape for
      the subsequent `[' character. If you want to avoid this ambiguity
      on Win32, you should use the forward slash `/' even for Win32
      pathnames (the `/' is translated to `\' in the output).

        strings : String Sequence
     $(glob options, strings) : Node Array
        options : String
        strings : String Sequence
>>
  
  The `glob' function performs glob-expansion.
  The . and .. entries are always ignored.
  The options are: 
  
 b  Do not perform csh(1)-style brace expansion. 
 e  The `\' character does not escape special characters. 
 n  If an expansion fails, return the expansion literally instead of
   aborting. 
 i  If an expansion fails, it expands to nothing. 
 .  Allow wildcard patterns to match files beginning with a . 
 A  Return all files, including files that begin with a . 
 F  Match only normal files (any file that is not a directory). 
 D  Match only directory files. 
 C  Ignore files according to cvs(1) rules. 
 P  Include only proper subdirectories. 
  
  In addition, the following variables may be defined that affect the
behavior of `glob'.
  
  
 GLOB_OPTIONS  A string containing default options. 
 GLOB_IGNORE  A list of shell patterns for filenames that `glob' should
   ignore. 
 GLOB_ALLOW  A list of shell patterns. If a file does not match a
   pattern in  `GLOB_ALLOW', it is ignored. 
  
  The returned files are sorted by name.

9.4.2  ls
=========
  
<<
     $(ls files) : Node Array
        files : String Sequence
     $(ls options, files) : Node Array
        files : String Sequence
>>
  
  The `ls' function returns the filenames in a directory.
  The . and .. entries are always ignored. The patterns are shell-style
patterns, and are glob-expanded.
  The options include all of the options to the `glob' function, plus
the following.
  
  
 R  Perform a recursive listing. 
  
  The `GLOB_ALLOW' and `GLOB_IGNORE' variables can be defined to control
the globbing behavior. The returned files are sorted by name.

9.4.3  subdirs
==============
  
<<
     $(subdirs dirs) : Dir Array
        dirs : String Sequence
     $(subdirs options, dirs) : Dir Array
        options : String
        dirs : String Sequence
>>
  
  The `subdirs' function returns all the subdirectories of a list of
directories, recursively.
  The possible options are the following: 
  
 A  Return directories that begin with a . 
 C  Ignore files according to .cvsignore rules. 
 P  Include only proper subdirectories.

     raises RuntimeException
  
     mkdir(node...)
        node : Node
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `mkdir' function creates a directory, or a set of directories. The
following options are supported. 
  
 -m mode  Specify the permissions of the created directory. 
 -p  Create parent directories if they do not exist. 
 --  Interpret the remaining names literally. 


9.5.2  Stat
===========
  
  The `Stat' object represents the result returned by the `stat' and
`lstat' functions. It contains the following fields.
  A `stat' object has the following fields. Not all of the fields will
have meaning on all architectures.
  
  
 dev : the device number. 
 ino : the inode number. 
 kind : the kind of the file, one of the following:  `REG' (regular
   file),  `DIR' (directory),  `CHR' (character device),  `BLK' (block
   device),  `LNK' (symbolic link),  `FIFO' (named pipe),  `SOCK'
   (socket). 
 perm : access rights, represented as an integer. 
 nlink : number of links. 
 uid : user id of the owner. 
 gid : group id of the file's group. 
 rdev : device minor number. 
 size : size in bytes. 
 atime : last access time, as a floating point number. 
 mtime : last modification time, as a floating point number. 
 ctime : last status change time, as a floating point number. 
  
  

9.5.3  stat
===========
  
<<
      $(stat node...) : Stat
         node : Node or Channel
      $(lstat node...) : Stat
         node : Node or Channel
      raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `stat' functions return file information. If the file is a
symbolic link, the `stat' function refers to the destination of the
link; the `lstat' function refers to the link itself.

9.5.4  unlink
=============
  
<<
     $(unlink file...)
        file : File
     #(rm file...)
        file : File
     $(rmdir dir...)
        dir : Dir
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `unlink' and `rm' functions remove a file. The `rmdir' function
removes a directory.
  The following options are supported for `rm' and `rmdir'. 
  
 -f  ignore nonexistent files, never prompt. 
 -i  prompt before removal. 
 -r  remove the contents of directories recursively. 
 -v  explain what is going on. 
 --  the rest of the values are interpreted literally. 


9.5.5  rename
=============
  
<<
      rename(old, new)
         old : Node

      mv(nodes... dir)
         nodes : Node Sequence
         dir   : Dir
      cp(nodes... dir)
         nodes : Node Sequence
         dir   : Dir
      raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `rename' function changes the name of a file or directory named
`old' to `new'.
  The `mv' function is similar, but if `new' is a directory, and it
exists, then the files specified by the sequence are moved into the
directory. If not, the behavior of `mv' is identical to `rename'. The
`cp' function is similar, but the original file is not removed.
  The `mv' and `cp' functions take the following options. 
  
 -f  Do not prompt before overwriting. 
 -i  Prompt before overwriting. 
 -v  Explain what it happening. 
 -r  Copy the contents of directories recursively. 
 --  Interpret the remaining arguments literally. 


9.5.6  link
===========
  
<<
     link(src, dst)
        src : Node
        dst : Node
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `link' function creates a hard link named `dst' to the file or
directory `src'.
  Hard links are not supported in Win32.
  Normally, only the superuser can create hard links to directories.

9.5.7  symlink
==============
  
<<
     symlink(src, dst)
        src : Node
        dst : Node
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `symlink' function creates a symbolic link `dst' that points to
the `src' file.
  The link name is computed relative to the target directory. For
example, the expression `$(symlink a/b, c/d)' creates a link named `c/d
-> ../a/b'.
  Symbolic links are not supported in Win32.

9.5.8  readlink
===============
  
<<
     $(readlink node...) : Node
        node : Node
>>
  
  The `readlink' function reads the value of a symbolic link.

9.5.9  chmod
============
  
<<
     chmod(mode, dst...)
        mode : Int
        dst : Node or Channel
     chmod(mode dst...)
        mode : String
        dst : Node Sequence
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `chmod' function changes the permissions of the targets. The
`chmod' function does nothing on Win32 platforms.
  Options: 
  
 -v  Explain what is happening. 
 -r  Change files and directories recursively. 
 -f  Continue on errors. 
 --  Interpret the remaining argument literally. 


9.5.10  chown
=============
  
<<
     chown(uid, gid, node...)
        uid : Int
        gid : Int
        node : Node or Channel
     chown(uid, node...)
        uid : Int
        node : Node or Channel
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `chown' function changes the user and group id of the file. If the
`gid' is not specified, it is not changed. If either id is -1, that id
is not changed.

9.5.11  truncate
================
  
<<
     truncate(length, node...)
         length : Int
         node : Node or Channel
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `truncate' function truncates a file to the given length.

9.5.12  umask
=============
  
<<
      $(umask mode) : Int
         mode : Int
      raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  Sets the file mode creation mask. The previous mask is returned. This
value is not scoped, changes have global effect.

9.6  vmount
*=*=*=*=*=*



9.6.1  vmount
=============
  
<<
      vmount(src, dst)
         src, dst : Dir
      vmount(flags, src, dst)
         flags : String
         src, dst : Dir
>>
  
  ``Mount'' the `src' directory on the `dst' directory. This is a
virtual mount, changing the behavior of the `$(file ...)' function. When
the `$(file str)' function is used, the resulting file is taken relative
to the `src' directory if the file exists. Otherwise, the file is
relative to the current directory.
  The main purpose of the `vmount' function is to support multiple
builds with separate configurations or architectures.
  The options are as follows. 
  
 l  Create symbolic links to files in the `src' directory. 
 c  Copy files from the `src' directory. 
  
  Mount operations are scoped.

9.6.2  add-project-directories
==============================
  
<<
      add-project-directories(dirs)
         dirs : Dir Array
>>
  
  Add the directories to the set of directories that omake considers to
be part of the project. This is mainly used to avoid omake complaining
that the current directory is not part of the project.

9.6.3  remove-project-directories
=================================
  
<<
      remove-project-directories(dirs)
         dirs : Dir Array
>>
  
  Removed the directories from the set of directories that omake
considers to be part of the project. This is mainly used to cancel a
`.SUBDIRS' from including a directory if it is determined that the
directory does not need to be compiled.

 - `!' expression : expression is not true 
 - expression1 `-a' expression2 : both expressions are true 
 - expression1 `-o' expression2 : at least one expression is true 
 - `(' expression `)' : expression is true 
  
  The base expressions are:
  
  
 - `-n' string : The string has nonzero length 
 - `-z' string : The string has zero length 
 - string `=' string : The strings are equal 
 - string `!=' string : The strings are not equal
 
 - int1 `-eq' int2 : The integers are equal 
 - int1 `-ne' int2 : The integers are not equal 
 - int1 `-gt' int2 : int1 is larger than int2 
 - int1 `-ge' int2 : int2 is not larger than int1 
 - int1 `-lt' int2 : int1 is smaller than int2 
 - int1 `-le' int2 : int1 is not larger than int2
 
 - file1 `-ef' file2 : On Unix, file1 and file2 have the  same device
   and inode number.  On Win32, file1 and file2 have the  same name. 
 - file1 `-nt' file2 : file1 is newer than file2 
 - file1 `-ot' file2 : file1 is older than file2
 
 - `-b' file : The file is a block special file 
 - `-c' file : The file is a character special file 
 - `-d' file : The file is a directory 
 - `-e' file : The file exists 
 - `-f' file : The file is a normal file 
 - `-g' file : The set`-group'`-id' bit is set on the file 
 - `-G' file : The file's group is the current effective group 
 - `-h' file : The file is a symbolic link (also `-L') 
 - `-k' file : The file's sticky bit is set 
 - `-L' file : The file is a symbolic link (also `-h') 
 - `-O' file : The file's owner is the current effective user 
 - `-p' file : The file is a named pipe 
 - `-r' file : The file is readable 
 - `-s' file : The file is empty 
 - `-S' file : The file is a socket 
 - `-u' file : The set`-user'`-id' bit is set on the file 
 - `-w' file : The file is writable 
 - `-x' file : The file is executable 
  
  A string is any sequence of characters; leading `-' characters are
allowed.
  An int is a string that can be interpreted as an integer. Unlike
traditional versions of the test program, the leading characters may
specify an arity. The prefix `0b' means the numbers is in binary; the
prefix `0o' means the number is in octal; the prefix `0x' means the
number is in hexadecimal. An int can also be specified as `-l' string,
which evaluates to the length of the string.
  A file is a string that represents the name of a file.
  The syntax mirrors that of the test(1) program. If you are on a Unix
system, the man page explains more. Here are some examples.
<<
      # Create an empty file
      osh> touch foo
      # Is the file empty?
      osh> test(-e foo)
      - : true
      osh> test(! -e foo)
      - : false
      # Create another file
      osh> touch boo
      # Is the newer file newer?
      osh> test(boo -nt foo)
      - : true
      # A more complex query
      # boo is newer than foo, and foo is empty
      osh> test(\( boo -nt foo \) -a -e foo)
      - : true
>>
  

9.7.2  find
===========
  
<<
     find(exp) : Node Array
        exp : String Sequence
>>
  
  The `find' function searches a directory recursively, returning the
files for which the expression evaluates to true.
  The expression argument uses the same syntax as the `test' function,
with the following exceptions.
  
  
 1. The expression may begin with a directory. If not specified, the
   current  directory is searched. 
 2. The `{}' string expands to the current file being examined. 
  
  The syntax of the expression is the same as `test', with the following
additions.
  
  
 - `-name' string : The current file matches the glob expression (see
   Section 9.4). 
  
  The `find' function performs a recursive scan of all subdirectories.
The following call is being run from the root of the `omake' source
directory.
<<
      osh> find(. -name fo* )
      - : <array
              /home/jyh/.../omake/mk/.svn/format
              /home/jyh/.../omake/RPM/.svn/format
              ...
             
/home/jyh/.../omake/osx_resources/installer_files/.svn/format>
>>
  
  Another example, listing only those files that are normal files or
symbolic links.
<<
      osh> find(. -name fo* -a \( -f {} -o -L {} \))
      - : <array
              /home/jyh/.../omake/mk/.svn/format
              /home/jyh/.../omake/RPM/.svn/format
              ...
             
/home/jyh/.../omake/osx_resources/installer_files/.svn/format>

  The `fopen' function opens a file for reading or writing.
<<
     $(fopen file, mode) : Channel
        file : File
        mode : String
>>
  
  The `file' is the name of the file to be opened. The `mode' is a
combination of the following characters. 
  
 r  Open the file for reading; it is an error if the file does not
   exist.

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  

9.11.1  Regular expressions
===========================
   
  Many of the higher-level functions use regular expressions. Regular
expressions are defined by strings with syntax nearly identical to
awk(1).
  Strings may contain the following character constants.
  
  
 - `\\' : a literal backslash. 
 - `\a' : the alert character `^G'. 
 - `\b' : the backspace character `^H'. 
 - `\f' : the formfeed character `^L'. 
 - `\n' : the newline character `^J'. 
 - `\r' : the carriage return character `^M'. 
 - `\t' : the tab character `^I'. 
 - `\v' : the vertical tab character. 
 - `\xhh...' : the character represented by the string  of hexadecimal
   digits `h'. All valid hexadecimal digits  following the sequence are
   considered to be part of the sequence. 
 - `\ddd' : the character represented by 1, 2, or 3 octal  digits. 
  
  Regular expressions are defined using the special characters
`.\^$[(){}*?'+.
  
  
 - `c' : matches the literal character `c' if `c' is not  a special
   character. 
 - `\c' : matches the literal character `c', even if `c'  is a special
   character. 
 - `.' : matches any character, including newline. 
 - `^' : matches the beginning of a line. 
 - `$' : matches the end of line. 
 - `[abc...]' : matches any of the characters `abc...' 
 - `[^abc...]' : matches any character except `abc...' 
 - `r1|r2' : matches either `r1' or `r2'. 
 - `r1r2' : matches `r1' and then `r2'. 
 - `r'+ : matches one or more occurrences of `r'. 
 - `r*' : matches zero or more occurrences of `r'. 
 - `r?' : matches zero or one occurrence of `r'. 
 - `(r)' : parentheses are used for grouping; matches `r'. 
 - `\(r\)' : also defines grouping, but the expression matched  within
   the parentheses is available to the output processor  through one of
   the variables `$1', `$2', ... 
 - `r{n}' : matches exactly `n' occurrences of `r'. 
 - `r{n,}' : matches `n' or more occurrences of `r'. 
 - `r{n,m}' : matches at least `n' occurrences of `r',  and no more than
   `m' occurrences. 
 - `\y': matches the empty string at either the beginning or  end of a
   word. 
 - `\B': matches the empty string within a word. 
 - `\<': matches the empty string at the beginning of a word. 
 - `\>': matches the empty string at the end of a word. 
 - `\w': matches any character in a word. 
 - `\W': matches any character that does not occur within a word. 
 - `\`': matches the empty string at the beginning of a file. 
 - `\'': matches the empty string at the end of a file. 
  
  Character classes can be used to specify character sequences
abstractly. Some of these sequences can change depending on your LOCALE.
  
  
 - `[:alnum:]' Alphanumeric characters. 
 - `[:alpha:]' Alphabetic characters. 
 - `[:lower:]' Lowercase alphabetic characters. 
 - `[:upper:]' Uppercase alphabetic characters. 
 - `[:cntrl:]' Control characters. 
 - `[:digit:]' Numeric characters. 
 - `[:xdigit:]' Numeric and hexadecimal characters. 
 - `[:graph:]' Characters that are printable and visible. 
 - `[:print:]' Characters that are printable, whether they are visible
   or not. 
 - `[:punct:]' Punctuation characters. 
 - `[:blank:]' Space or tab characters. 
 - `[:space:]' Whitespace characters.

===========
  
<<
      cat(files) : Sequence

        files   : File Sequence
     grep(options, pattern, files) : String
       options : String
       pattern : String
       files   : File Sequence
>>
  
  The `grep' function searches for occurrences of a regular expression
`pattern' in a set of files, and prints lines that match. This is like a
highly-simplified version of grep(1).
  The options are: 
  
 q  If specified, the output from `grep' is not displayed. 
 h  If specified, output lines will not include the filename (default,
   when only one input  file is given). 
 n  If specified, output lines include the filename (default, when more
   than one input file  is given). 
 v  If specified, search for lines without a match instead of lines with
   a match, 
  
  The `pattern' is a regular expression.
  If successful (`grep' found a match), the function returns `true'.
Otherwise, it returns `false'.

9.11.4  scan
============
  
<<
     scan(input-files)
     case string1
        body1
     case string2
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The `scan' function provides input processing in command-line form.
The function takes file/filename arguments. If called with no arguments,
the input is taken from `stdin'. If arguments are provided, each
specifies an `InChannel', or the name of a file for input. Output is
always to `stdout'.
  The `scan' function operates by reading the input one line at a time,
and processing it according to the following algorithm.
  For each line, the record is first split into fields, and the fields
are bound to the variables `$1, $2, ...'. The variable `$0' is defined
to be the entire line, and `$*' is an array of all the field values. The
`$(NF)' variable is defined to be the number of fields.
  Next, a case expression is selected. If `string_i' matches the token
`$1', then `body_i' is evaluated. If the body ends in an `export', the
state is passed to the next clause. Otherwise the value is discarded.
  For example, here is an `scan' function that acts as a simple command
processor.
<<
      calc() =
         i = 0
         scan(script.in)
         case print
            println($i)
         case inc
            i = $(add $i, 1)
            export
         case dec
            i = $(sub $i, 1)
            export
         case addconst
            i = $(add $i, $2)
            export
         default
            eprintln($"Unknown command: $1")
>>
  
  The `scan' function also supports several options.
<<
      scan(options, files)
      ...
>>
  
  
  
 A  Parse each line as an argument list, where arguments  may be quoted.
   For example, the following line has three words,  ```ls''', ```-l''',
   ```Program Files'''.
   <<
            ls -l "Program Files"
        >>
 
 O  Parse each line using white space as the separator, using the  usual
   OMake algorithm for string parsing. This is the default. 
 x  Once each line is split, reduce each word using the  hex
   representation. This is the usual hex representation used  in URL
   specifiers, so the string ``Program Files'' may be  alternately
   represented in the form ProgramProgram+Files. 
  
  Note, if you want to redirect the output to a file, the easiest way is
to redefine the `stdout' variable. The `stdout' variable is scoped the
same way as other variables, so this definition does not affect the
meaning of `stdout' outside the `calc' function.
<<
      calc() =
          stdout = $(fopen script.out, w)
          scan(script.in)
             ...
          close(stdout)
>>
  

9.11.5  awk
===========
  
<<
     awk(input-files)
     case pattern1:
        body1
     case pattern2:
        body2
     ...
     default:
        bodyd
>>
  
  or
<<
     awk(options, input-files)
     case pattern1:
        body1
     case pattern2:
        body2
     ...
     default:
        bodyd
>>
  
  The `awk' function provides input processing similar to awk(1), but
more limited. The `input-files' argument is a sequence of values, each
specifies an `InChannel', or the name of a file for input. If called
with no options and no file arguments, the input is taken from `stdin'.
Output is always to `stdout'.
  The variables `RS' and `FS' define record and field separators as
regular expressions. The default value of `RS' is the regular expression
`\r|\n|\r\n'. The default value of `FS' is the regular expression `[
\t]'+.
  The `awk' function operates by reading the input one record at a time,
and processing it according to the following algorithm.
  For each line, the record is first split into fields using the field
separator `FS', and the fields are bound to the variables `$1, $2, ...'.
The variable `$0' is defined to be the entire line, and `$*' is an array
of all the field values. The `$(NF)' variable is defined to be the
number of fields.
  Next, the cases are evaluated in order. For each case, if the regular
expression `pattern_i' matches the record `$0', then `body_i' is
evaluated. If the body ends in an `export', the state is passed to the
next clause. Otherwise the value is discarded. If the regular expression
contains `\(r\)' expression, those expression override the fields `$1,
$2, ...'.
  For example, here is an `awk' function to print the text between two
delimiters `\begin{<name>}' and `\end{<name>}', where the `<name>' must
belong to a set passed as an argument to the `filter' function.
<<
      filter(names) =
         print = false
  
         awk(Awk.in)
         case $"^\\end\{\([:alpha:]+\)\}"
            if $(mem $1, $(names))
               print = false
               export
            export
         default
            if $(print)
               println($0)
         case $"^\\begin\{\([:alpha:]+\)\}"
            print = $(mem $1, $(names))
            export
>>
  
  Note, if you want to redirect the output to a file, the easiest way is
to redefine the `stdout' variable. The `stdout' variable is scoped the
same way as other variables, so this definition does not affect the
meaning of `stdout' outside the `filter' function.
<<
      filter(names) =
          stdout = $(fopen file.out, w)
          awk(Awk.in)
             ...
          close(stdout)
>>
  
  Options. 
  
 b  ``Break'' when evaluating cases. Only the first case that matches
   will be selected. 
  
  The `break' function (Section 8.3.43) can be used to abort the loop,
exiting the `awk' function immediately.

9.11.6  fsubst
==============
  
<<
     fsubst(files)
     case pattern1 [options]
        body1
     case pattern2 [options]
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The `fsubst' function provides a sed(1)-like substitution function.
Similar to `awk', if `fsubst' is called with no arguments, the input is
taken from `stdin'. If arguments are provided, each specifies an
`InChannel', or the name of a file for input.
  The `RS' variable defines a regular expression that determines a
record separator, The default value of `RS' is the regular expression
`\r|\n|\r\n'.
  The `fsubst' function reads the file one record at a time.
  For each record, the cases are evaluated in order. Each case defines a
substitution from a substring matching the `pattern' to replacement text
defined by the body.
  Currently, there is only one option: `g'. If specified, each clause
specifies a global replacement, and all instances of the pattern define
a substitution. Otherwise, the substitution is applied only once.
  Output can be redirected by redefining the `stdout' variable.
  For example, the following program replaces all occurrences of an
expression `word.' with its capitalized form.
<<
      section
         stdout = $(fopen Subst.out, w)
         fsubst(Subst.in)
         case $"\<\([[:alnum:]]+\)\." g
            value $(capitalize $1).
         close(stdout)
>>
  

9.11.7  lex
===========
  
<<
     lex(files)
     case pattern1
        body1
     case pattern2
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The `lex' function provides a simple lexical-style scanner function.
The input is a sequence of files or channels. The cases specify regular
expressions. Each time the input is read, the regular expression that
matches the longest prefix of the input is selected, and the body is
evaluated.
  If two clauses both match the same input, the last one is selected for
execution. The `default' case matches the regular expression `.'; you
probably want to place it first in the pattern list.
  If the body end with an `export' directive, the state is passed to the
next clause.
  For example, the following program collects all occurrences of
alphanumeric words in an input file.
<<
      collect-words($(files)) =
         words[] =
         lex($(files))
         default
            # empty
         case $"[[:alnum:]]+" g
            words[] += $0
            export
>>
  
  The `default' case, if one exists, matches single characters. Since
  It is an error if the input does not match any of the regular
expressions.
  The `break' function (Section 8.3.43) can be used to abort the loop.

9.11.8  lex-search
==================
  
<<
     lex-search(files)
     case pattern1
        body1
     case pattern2
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The `lex-search' function is like the `lex' function, but input that
does not match any of the regular expressions is skipped. If the clauses
include a `default' case, then the `default' matches any skipped text.
  For example, the following program collects all occurrences of
alphanumeric words in an input file, skipping any other text.
<<
      collect-words($(files)) =
         words[] =
         lex-search($(files))
         default
            eprintln(Skipped $0)
         case $"[[:alnum:]]+" g
            words[] += $0
            export
>>
  
  The `default' case, if one exists, matches single characters. Since
  It is an error if the input does not match any of the regular
expressions.
  The `break' function (Section 8.3.43) can be used to abort the loop.

9.11.9  Lexer
=============
  
  The `Lexer' object defines a facility for lexical analysis, similar to
the lex(1) and flex(1) programs.
  In omake, lexical analyzers can be constructed dynamically by
extending the `Lexer' class. A lexer definition consists of a set of
directives specified with method calls, and set of clauses specified as
rules.
  For example, consider the following lexer definition, which is
intended for lexical analysis of simple arithmetic expressions for a
desktop calculator.
<<
     lexer1. =
        extends $(Lexer)
  
        other: .
           eprintln(Illegal character: $* )
           lex()
  
        white: $"[[:space:]]+"
           lex()
  
        op: $"[-+*/()]"
           switch $*
           case +
              Token.unit($(loc), plus)
           case -
              Token.unit($(loc), minus)
           case *
              Token.unit($(loc), mul)
           case /
              Token.unit($(loc), div)
           case $"("
              Token.unit($(loc), lparen)
           case $")"
              Token.unit($(loc), rparen)
  
        number: $"[[:digit:]]+"
           Token.pair($(loc), exp, $(int $* ))
  
        eof: $"\'"
           Token.unit($(loc), eof)
>>
  
  This program defines an object `lexer1' the extends the `Lexer'
object, which defines lexing environment.
  The remainder of the definition consists of a set of clauses, each
with a method name before the colon; a regular expression after the
colon; and in this case, a body. The body is optional, if it is not
specified, the method with the given name should already exist in the
lexer definition.
  NB The clause that matches the longest prefix of the input is
selected. If two clauses match the same input prefix, then the last one
is selected. This is unlike most standard lexers, but makes more sense
for extensible grammars.
  The first clause matches any input that is not matched by the other
clauses. In this case, an error message is printed for any unknown
character, and the input is skipped. Note that this clause is selected
only if no other clause matches.
  The second clause is responsible for ignoring white space. If
whitespace is found, it is ignored, and the lexer is called recursively.
  The third clause is responsible for the arithmetic operators. It makes
use of the `Token' object, which defines three fields: a `loc' field
that represents the source location; a `name'; and a `value'.
  The lexer defines the `loc' variable to be the location of the current
lexeme in each of the method bodies, so we can use that value to create
the tokens.
  The `Token.unit($(loc), name)' method constructs a new `Token' object
with the given name, and a default value.
  The `number' clause matches nonnegative integer constants. The
`Token.pair($(loc), name, value)' constructs a token with the given name
and value.
  Lexer object operate on `InChannel' objects. The method
`lexer1.lex-channel(channel)' reads the next token from the channel
argument.
  

9.11.10  Lexer matching
=======================
  
  During lexical analysis, clauses are selected by longest match. That
is, the clause that matches the longest sequence of input characters is
chosen for evaluation. If no clause matches, the lexer raises a
`RuntimeException'. If more than one clause matches the same amount of
input, the first one is chosen for evaluation.
  

9.11.11  Extending lexer definitions
====================================
  
  Suppose we wish to augment the lexer example so that it ignores
comments. We will define comments as any text that begins with the
string `(*', ends with `*)', and comments may be nested.
  One convenient way to do this is to define a separate lexer just to
skip comments.
<<
     lex-comment. =
        extends $(Lexer)
  
        level = 0
  
        other: .
           lex()
  
        term: $"[*][)]"
           if $(not $(eq $(level), 0))
              level = $(sub $(level), 1)
              lex()
  
        next: $"[(][*]"
           level = $(add $(level), 1)
           lex()
  
        eof: $"\'"
           eprintln(Unterminated comment)
>>
  
  This lexer contains a field `level' that keeps track of the nesting
level. On encountering a `(*' string, it increments the level, and for
`*)', it decrements the level if nonzero, and continues.
  Next, we need to modify our previous lexer to skip comments. We can do
this by extending the lexer object `lexer1' that we just created.
<<
     lexer1. +=
        comment: $"[(][*]"
           lex-comment.lex-channel($(channel))
           lex()
>>
  
  The body for the comment clause calls the `lex-comment' lexer when a
comment is encountered, and continues lexing when that lexer returns.
  

9.11.12  Threading the lexer object
===================================
  
  Clause bodies may also end with an `export' directive. In this case
the lexer object itself is used as the returned token. If used with the
`Parser' object below, the lexer should define the `loc', `name' and
`value' fields in each `export' clause. Each time the `Parser' calls the
lexer, it calls it with the lexer returned from the previous lex
invocation.

9.11.13  Parser
===============
  
  The `Parser' object provides a facility for syntactic analysis based
on context-free grammars.
  `Parser' objects are specified as a sequence of directives, specified
with method calls; and productions, specified as rules.
  For example, let's finish building the desktop calculator started in
the `Lexer' example.
<<
     parser1. =
        extends $(Parser)
  
        #
        # Use the main lexer
        #
        lexer = $(lexer1)
  
        #
        # Precedences, in ascending order
        #
        left(plus minus)
        left(mul div)
        right(uminus)
  
        #
        # A program
        #
        start(prog)
  
        prog: exp eof
           return $1
  
        #
        # Simple arithmetic expressions
        #
        exp: minus exp :prec: uminus
           neg($2)
  
        exp: exp plus exp
           add($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp minus exp
           sub($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp mul exp
           mul($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp div exp
           div($1, $3)
  
        exp: lparen exp rparen
           return $2
>>
  
  Parsers are defined as extensions of the `Parser' class. A `Parser'
object must have a `lexer' field. The `lexer' is not required to be a
`Lexer' object, but it must provide a `lexer.lex()' method that returns
a token object with `name' and `value' fields. For this example, we use
the `lexer1' object that we defined previously.
  The next step is to define precedences for the terminal symbols. The
precedences are defined with the `left', `right', and `nonassoc' methods
in order of increasing precedence.
  The grammar must have at least one start symbol, declared with the
`start' method.
  Next, the productions in the grammar are listed as rules. The name of
the production is listed before the colon, and a sequence of variables
is listed to the right of the colon. The body is a semantic action to be
evaluated when the production is recognized as part of the input.
  In this example, these are the productions for the arithmetic
expressions recognized by the desktop calculator. The semantic action
performs the calculation. The variables `$1, $2, ...' correspond to the
values associated with each of the variables on the right-hand-side of
the production.
  

9.11.14  Calling the parser
===========================
  
  The parser is called with the `$(parser1.parse-channel start,
channel)' or `$(parser1.parse-file start, file)' functions. The `start'
argument is the start symbol, and the `channel' or `file' is the input
to the parser.
  

9.11.15  Parsing control
========================
  
  The parser generator generates a pushdown automation based on LALR(1)
tables. As usual, if the grammar is ambiguous, this may generate
shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts. These conflicts are printed to
standard output when the automaton is generated.
  By default, the automaton is not constructed until the parser is first
used.
  The `build(debug)' method forces the construction of the automaton.
While not required, it is wise to finish each complete parser with a
call to the `build(debug)' method. If the `debug' variable is set, this
also prints with parser table together with any conflicts.
  The `loc' variable is defined within action bodies, and represents the
input range for all tokens on the right-hand-side of the production.
  

9.11.16  Extending parsers
==========================
  
  Parsers may also be extended by inheritance. For example, let's extend
the grammar so that it also recognizes the `<<' and `>>' shift
operations.
  First, we extend the lexer so that it recognizes these tokens. This
time, we choose to leave `lexer1' intact, instead of using the +=
operator.
<<
     lexer2. =
        extends $(lexer1)
  
        lsl: $"<<"
           Token.unit($(loc), lsl)
  
        asr: $">>"
           Token.unit($(loc), asr)
>>
  
  Next, we extend the parser to handle these new operators. We intend
that the bitwise operators have lower precedence than the other
arithmetic operators. The two-argument form of the `left' method
accomplishes this.
<<
     parser2. =
        extends $(parser1)
  
        left(plus, lsl lsr asr)
  
        lexer = $(lexer2)
  
        exp: exp lsl exp
           lsl($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp asr exp
           asr($1, $3)
>>
  
  In this case, we use the new lexer `lexer2', and we add productions
for the new shift operations.

9.11.17  gettimeofday
=====================
  
<<
     $(gettimeofday) : Float
>>
  
  The `gettimeofday' function returns the time of day in seconds since
January 1, 1970.
  

Chapter 10    Shell commands
****************************
    
  Shell commands (commands to be executed by the operating system) can
be freely mixed with other code.
  NOTE: the syntax and shell usage is identical on all platforms,
including Win32. To avoid portability problems on Win32, it is
recommended that you avoid the use of the native shell interpreter
`cmd'.
<<
      LIB = $(dir lib)
      println(The contents of the $(LIB) directory is:)
      ls $(LIB)
>>
  
  

10.1  Simple commands
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  The syntax of shell commands is similar to the syntax used by the Unix
shell `bash'. In general, a command is a pipeline. A basic command is
part of a pipeline. It is specified with the name of an executable and
some arguments. Here are some examples.
<<
      ls
      ls -AF .
      echo Hello world
>>
  
  The command is found using the current search path in the variable
`PATH[]', which should define an array of directories containing
executables.
  A command may also be prefixed by environment variable definitions.
<<
      # Prints "Hello world"
      env X="Hello world" Y=2 printenv X
      # Pass the include path to the Visual C++
      env include="c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDK\include" cl foo.cpp
>>
  
  

10.2  Globbing
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Commands may contain wildcard patterns. A pattern specifies a set of
files through a limited kind of regular expression. Patterns are
expanded before the function is executed.
<<
     # List all files with a .c suffix
     ls *.c
  
     # List all files with a single character prefix, and .c suffix
     ls ?.c
  
     # Rename the file hello.ml to foo.ml
     mv {hello,foo}.ml
>>
  
  A comprehensive description of OMake glob patterns is given in Section
9.4.
  

10.3  Background jobs
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  The command may also be placed in the background by placing an
ampersand after the command. Control returns to the shell without
waiting for the job to complete. The job continues to run in the
background.
<<
      gcc -o hugeprogram *.c &
>>
  
  

10.4  File redirection
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Input and output can be redirected to files by using the `<', `>', and
`>&' directives after the command.
<<
      # Write to the "foo" file
      echo Hello world > foo
  
      # Redirect input from the foo file
      cat < foo
  
      # Redirect standard output and errors to the foo file
      gcc -o boo *.c >& foo
>>
  
  

10.5  Pipelines
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Pipelines are sequences of commands, where the output from each
command is sent to the next. Pipelines are defined with the `|' and `|&'
syntax. With `|' the output is redirected, but errors are not. With `|&'
both output and errors are redirected.
<<
     # Send the output of the ls command to the printer
     ls *.c | lpr
  
     # Send output and errors to jyh as email
     gcc -o hugefile *.c |& mail jyh
>>
  
  

10.6  Conditional execution
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Commands may also be composed though conditional evaluation using the
`||' and `&&' syntax. Every command has an integer exit code, which may
be zero or some other integer. A command is said to succeed if its exit
code is zero. The expression `command1 && command2' executes `command2'
only if `command1' succeeds. The expression `command1 || command2'
executes `command2' only if `command1' fails.
<<
     # Display the x/y file if possible
     cd x && cat y
  
     # Run foo.exe, or print an error message
     (test -x foo.exe && foo.exe) || echo "foo.exe is not executable"
>>
  
  

10.7  Grouping
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Parenthesis are used for grouping in a pipeline or conditional
command. In the following expression, the `test' function is used to
test whether the `foo.exe' file is executable. If it is, the `foo.exe'
file is executed. If the file is not executable (or if the `foo.exe'
command fails), the message `"foo.exe is not executable"' is printed.
<<
     # Run foo.exe, or print an error message
     (test -x foo.exe && foo.exe) || echo "foo.exe is not executable"
>>
  
  

10.8  What is a shell command?
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  Syntactially, shell commands are any line that is not one of the
following:
  
  
 - A variable definition of the form `VAR=string' 
 - A function call `f(...)' or method call `o.f(...)' 
 - A rule definition containing a colon `string: ...' 
 - A special command, including the following: 
     
    - `if ...' 
    - `switch ...' 
    - `match ...' 
    - `section ...' 
    - `return ...' 
  
  
  Commands may also be builtin (aliases). See the documentation for the
`Shell' object (Section 11.1.23) for more information.
  

10.9  Basic builtin functions
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*



10.9.1  echo
============
  
  The `echo' function prints a string.
<<
  $(echo <args>)
  echo <args>
>>
  

10.9.2  cd
==========
  
  The `cd' function changes the current directory.
<<
      cd(dir)
         dir : Dir
>>
  
  The `cd' function also supports a 2-argument form:
<<
      $(cd dir, e)
         dir : Dir
         e : expression
>>
  
  In the two-argument form, expression `e' is evaluated in the directory
`dir'. The current directory is not changed otherwise.
  The behavior of the `cd' function can be changed with the `CDPATH'
variable, which specifies a search path for directories. This is
normally useful only in the osh command interpreter.
<<
      CDPATH : Dir Sequence
>>
  
  For example, the following will change directory to the first
directory `./foo', `~/dir1/foo', `~/dir2/foo'.
<<
      CDPATH[] =
         .
         $(HOME)/dir1
         $(HOME)/dir2
      cd foo
>>
  
  

10.10  Job control builtin functions
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=



10.10.1  jobs
=============
  
  The `jobs' function prints a list of jobs.
  `jobs'

10.10.2  bg
===========
  
  The `bg' function places a job in the background.
  `bg <pid...>'

10.10.3  fg
===========
  
  The `fg' function brings a job to the foreground.
  `fg <pid...>'

10.10.4  stop
=============
  
  The `stop' function suspends a job.
  `stop <pid...>'

10.10.5  wait
=============
  
  The `wait' function waits for a job to finish. If no process
identifiers are given, the shell waits for all jobs to complete.
  `wait <pid...>'

10.10.6  kill
=============
  
  The `kill' function signals a job.
  `kill [signal] <pid...>'

10.11  Command history
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=



10.11.1  history
================
  
<<
      $(history-index) : Int
      $(history) : String Sequence
      history-file : File
      history-length : Int
>>
  
  The history variables manage the command-line history in osh. They
have no effect in omake.
  The `history-index' variable is the current index into the
command-line history. The `history' variable is the current command-line
history.
  The `history-file' variable can be redefined if you want the
command-line history to be saved. The default value is
`~/.omake/osh_history'.
  The `history-length' variable can be redefined to specify the maximum
number of lines in the history that you want saved. The default value is
`100'.

Chapter 11    Pervasives
************************
    
  `Pervasives' defines the objects that are defined in all programs. The
following objects are defined.
  

11.1  Pervasives objects
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  

11.1.1  Object
==============
  
  Parent objects: none.
  The `Object' object is the root object. Every class is a subclass of
`Object'.
  It provides the following fields:
  
  
 - `$(o.object-length)': the number of fields and methods in the object.
   
 - `$(o.object-mem <var>)': returns `true' iff the `<var>' is a field 
   or method of the object. 
 - `$(o.object-add <var>, <value>)': adds the field to the object, 
   returning a new object. 
 - `$(o.object-find <var>)': fetches the field or method from the
   object;  it is equivalent to `$(o.<var>)', but the variable can be
   non-constant. 
 - `$(o.object-map <fun>)': maps a function over the object. The
   function  should take two arguments; the first is a field name, the
   second is the  value of that field. The result is a new object
   constructed from the  values returned by the function. 
 - `o.object-foreach': the `foreach' form is equivalent to `map',  but
   with altered syntax.
   <<
        o.foreach(<var1>, <var2>)
           <body>
        >>
 
  For example, the following function prints all the fields of an 
   object `o'.
   <<
        PrintObject(o) =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              println($(v) = $(x))
        >>
 
  The `export' form is valid in a `foreach' body. The following 
   function collects just the field names of an object.
   <<
        FieldNames(o) =
           names =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              names += $(v)
              export
           return $(names)
        >>
  
  

11.1.2  Map
===========
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  A `Map' object is a dictionary from values to values. The `<key>'
values are restricted to simple values: integers, floating-point
numbers, strings, files, directories, and arrays of simple values.
  The Map object provides the following methods.
  
  
 - `$(o.mem <key>)': returns `true' iff the `<key>' is defined  in the
   map. 
 - `$(o.add <key>, <value>)': adds the field to the map,  returning a
   new map. 
 - `$(o.find <key>)': fetches the field from the map. 
 - `$(o.map <fun>)': maps a function over the map. The function  should
   take two arguments; the first is a field name, the second is the 
   value of that field. The result is a new object constructed from the 
   values returned by the function. 
 - `o.foreach': the `foreach' form is equivalent to `map',  but with
   altered syntax.
   <<
        o.foreach(<var1>, <var2>)
           <body>
        >>
 
  For example, the following function prints all the fields of an 
   object `o'.
   <<
        PrintObject(o) =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              println($(v) = $(x))
        >>
 
  The `export' form is valid in a `foreach' body. The following 
   function collects just the field names of the map.
   <<
        FieldNames(o) =
           names =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              names += $(v)
              export
           return $(names)
        >>
  
  There is also simpler syntax when the key is a string. The table can
be defined using definitions with the form `$|key|' (the number of pipe
symbols `|' is allowed to vary).
<<
      $|key 1| = value1
      $||key1|key2|| = value2    # The key is key1|key2
      X = $|key 1|               # Define X to be the value of field
$|key 1|
>>
  
  The usual modifiers are also allowed. The expression `$`|key|'
represents lazy evaluation of the key, and `$,|key|' is normal
evaluation.
  

11.1.3  Number
==============
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Number' object is the parent object for integers and
floating-point numbers.

11.1.4  Int
===========
  
  Parent objects: `Number'.
  The `Int' object represents integer values.

11.1.5  Float
=============
  
  Parent objects: `Number'.
  The `Float' object represents floating-point numbers.

11.1.6  Sequence
================
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Sequence' object represents a generic object containing
sequential elements. It provides the following methods.
  
  
 - `$(s.length)': the number of elements in the sequence. 
 - `$(s.map <fun>)': maps a function over the fields in the sequence. 
   The function should take one argument. The result is a new sequence 
   constructed from the values returned by the function. 
 - `s.foreach': the `foreach' form is equivalent to `map',  but with
   altered syntax.
   <<
        s.foreach(<var>)
           <body>
        >>
 
  For example, the following function prints all the elements of the
   sequence.
   <<
        PrintSequence(s) =
           s.foreach(x)
              println(Elem = $(x))
        >>
 
  The `export' form is valid in a `foreach' body. The following 
   function counts the number of zeros in the sequence.
   <<
        Zeros(s) =
           count = $(int 0)
           s.foreach(v)
              if $(equal $(v), 0)
                 count = $(add $(count), 1)
                 export
              export
           return $(count)
        >>


11.1.7  Array
=============
  
  Parent objects: `Sequence'.
  The `Array' is a random-access sequence. It provides the following
additional methods.
  
  
 - `$(s.nth <i>)': returns element `i' of the sequence. 
 - `$(s.rev <i>)': returns the reversed sequence. 
  
  

11.1.8  String
==============
  
  Parent objects: `Array'.

11.1.9  Fun
===========
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Fun' object provides the following methods. 
  
 - `$(f.arity)': the arity if the function. 


11.1.10  Rule
=============
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Rule' object represents a build rule. It does not currently have
any methods.

11.1.11  Target
===============
  
  Parent object: `Object'.
  The `Target' object contains information collected for a specific
target file.
  
  
 - `target': the target file. 
 - `effects': the files that may be modified by a  side-effect when this
   target is built. 
 - `scanner_deps': static dependencies that must be built  before this
   target can be scanned. 
 - `static-deps': statically-defined build dependencies  of this target.
   
 - `build-deps': all the build dependencies for the target,  including
   static and scanned dependencies. 
 - `build-values': all the value dependencies associated  with the
   build. 
 - `build-commands': the commands to build the target. 
 - `output-file': if output was diverted to a file,  with one of the
   `--divert-*' options A,  this field names that file. Otherwise it is
   `false'. 
  
  The object supports the following methods.
  
  
 - `find(file)': returns a Target object for the given file.  Raises a
   `RuntimeException' if the specified target is  not part of the
   project. 
 - `find-optional(file)': returns a `Target' object  for the given file,
   or `false' if the file is not  part of the project. 
  
  NOTE: the information for a target is constructed dynamically, so it
is possible that the `Target' object for a node will contain different
values in different contexts. The easiest way to make sure that the
`Target' information is complete is to compute it within a rule body,
where the rule depends on the target file, or the dependencies of the
target file.

11.1.12  Node
=============
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Node' object is the parent object for files and directories. It
supports the following operations. 
  
 - `$(node.stat)': returns a `stat' object for the file. If the file is
   a symbolic link, the `stat' information is for the destination of the
   link, not the link itself.
 
 - `$(node.lstat)': returns a `stat' object for the file or symbolic
   link. 
 - `$(node.unlink)': removes the file. 
 - `$(node.rename <file>)': renames the file. 
 - `$(node.link <file>)': creates a hard link `<dst>' to this file. 
 - `$(node.symlink <file>)': create a symbolic link `<dst>' to this
   file. 
 - `$(node.chmod <perm>)': change the permission of this file. 
 - `$(node.chown <uid>, <gid>)': change the owner and group id of this
   file. 


11.1.13  File
=============
  
  Parent objects: `Node'.
  The file object represents the name of a file.

11.1.14  Dir
============
  
  Parent objects: `Node'.
  The `Dir' object represents the name of a directory.

11.1.15  Channel
================
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  A `Channel' is a generic IO channel. It provides the following
methods. 
  
 - `$(o.close)': close the channel. 


11.1.16  InChannel
==================
  
  Parent objects: `Channel'.
  A `InChannel' is an input channel. The variable `stdin' is the
standard input channel.
  It provides the following methods. 
  
 - `$(InChannel.fopen <file>)': open a new input channel. 
 - `$(InChannel.of-string <string>)': open a new input channel, using a
   string as input. 


11.1.17  OutChannel
===================
  
  Parent object: `Channel'.
  A `OutChannel' is an output channel. The variables `stdout' and
`stderr' are the standard output and error channels.
  It provides the following methods. 
  
 - `$(OutChannel.fopen <file>)': open a new output channel. 
 - `$(OutChannel.string)': open a new output channel, writing to a
   string. 
 - `$(OutChannel.to-string)': get the current string of output, for an
   output channel created as `OutChannel.open-string'. 
 - `$(OutChannel.append <file>)': opens a new output channel, appending
   to the file. 
 - `$(c.flush)': flush the output channel. 
 - `$(c.print <string>)': print a string to the channel. 
 - `$(c.println <string>)': print a string to the channel, followed by a
   line terminator. 


11.1.18  Location
=================
  
  Parent objects: `Location'.
  The `Location' object represents a location in a file.

11.1.19  Position
=================
  
  Parent objects: `Position'.
  The `Position' object represents a stack trace.

11.1.20  Exception
==================
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Exception' object is used as the base object for exceptions. It
has no fields.

11.1.21  RuntimeException
=========================
  
  Parent objects: `Exception'.
  The `RuntimeException' object represents an exception from the runtime
system. It has the following fields.
  
  
 - `position': a string representing the location where the  exception
   was raised. 
 - `message': a string containing the exception message. 


11.1.22  UnbuildableException
=============================
  
  Parent objects: `Exception'.
  The `UnbuildableException' object should be used to signal that a
target is not buildable. It will be caught by functions such as
`target-exists' 9.3.1. This exception has the following fields:
  
  
 - `target': indicates which target is not buildable. 
 - `message': a string containing the exception message. 


11.1.23  Shell
==============
  
  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Shell' object contains the collection of builtin functions
available as shell commands.
  You can define aliases by extending this object with additional
methods. All methods in this class are called with one argument: a
single array containing an argument list.
  
  
 - `echo'
 The `echo' function prints its arguments to the standard output
   channel. 
 - `jobs'
 The `jobs' method prints the status of currently running commands. 
 - `cd'
 The `cd' function changes the current directory. Note that the current
   directory follows the usual scoping rules. For example, the following
   program lists the files in the `foo' directory, but the current
   directory is not changed.
   <<
        section
           echo Listing files in the foo directory...
           cd foo
           ls
     
        echo Listing files in the current directory...
        ls
   >>
 
 - `bg'
 The `bg' method places a job in the background. The job is resumed if
   it has been suspended. 
 - `fg'
 The `fg' method brings a job to the foreground. The job is resumed if
   it has been suspended. 
 - `stop'
 The `stop' method suspends a running job. 
 - `wait'
 The `wait' function waits for a running job to terminate. It is not
   possible to wait for a suspended job.
 The job is not brought to the foreground. If the `wait' is interrupted,
   the job continues to run in the background. 
 - `kill'
 The `kill' function signal a job.
 `kill [signal] <pid...>'.
 The signals are either numeric, or symbolic. The symbolic signals are
   named as follows.
 ABRT, ALRM, HUP, ILL, KILL, QUIT, SEGV, TERM, USR1, USR2, CHLD, STOP,
   TSTP, TTIN, TTOU, VTALRM, PROF. 
 - `exit'
 The `exit' function terminates the current session. 
 - `which', `where'
 See the documentation for the corresponding functions. 
 - `rehash'
 Reset the search path. 
 - `ln-or-cp' src dst
 Links or copies src to dst, overwriting dst. Namely, `ln-or-cp' would
   first delete the dst file (unless it is a directory), if it exists.
   Next it would try to create a symbolic link dst poiting to src (it
   will make all the necessary adjustmnents of relative paths). If
   symbolic link can not be created (e.g. the OS or the filesystem does
   not support symbolic links), it will try to create a hard link. If
   that fails too, it will try to forcibly copy src to dst. 
 - `history'
 Print the current command-line history. 
 - `digest'
 Print the digests of the given files. 
 - Win32 functions.
 Win32 doesn't provide very many programs for scripting, except  for the
   functions that are builtin to the DOS `cmd.exe'.  The following
   functions are defined on Win32 and only on Win32.  On other systems,
   it is expected that these programs already  exist.
 
     
    - `grep'
      <<
           grep [-q] [-n] pattern files...
      >>
    
    The `grep' function calls the omake `grep' function. 
  
 - Internal versions of standard system commands.
 By default, omake uses internal versions of the following commands:
   `cp', `mv', `cat', `rm', `mkdir', `chmod', `test', `find'. If you
   really want to use the standard system versions of these commands,
   set the `USE_SYSTEM_COMMANDS' as one of the first definitions in your
   `OMakeroot' file.
 
     
    - `mkdir'
      <<
            mkdir [-m <mode>] [-p] files
      >>
    
    The `mkdir' function is used to create directories. The -verb+-m+
      option can be used to specify the permission mode of the created
      directory. If the `-p' option is specified, the full path is
      created. 
    - `cp' 
    - `mv'
      <<
            cp [-f] [-i] [-v] src dst
            cp [-f] [-i] [-v] files dst
            mv [-f] [-i] [-v] src dst
            mv [-f] [-i] [-v] files dst
      >>
    
    The `cp' function copies a `src' file to a `dst' file, overwriting
      it if it already exists. If more than one source file is
      specified, the final file must be a directory, and the source
      files are copied into the directory.
    
        
       -f  Copy files forcibly, do not prompt. 
       -i  Prompt before removing destination files. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
     
    - `rm'
      <<
           rm [-f] [-i] [-v] [-r] files
           rmdir [-f] [-i] [-v] [-r] dirs
      >>
    
    The `rm' function removes a set of files. No warnings are issued if
      the files do not exist, or if they cannot be removed.
    Options: 
        
       -f  Forcibly remove files, do not prompt. 
       -i  Prompt before removal. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
       -r  Remove contents of directories recursively. 
     
    - `chmod'
      <<
            chmod [-r] [-v] [-f] mode files
      >>
    
    The `chmod' function changes the permissions on a set of files or
      directories. This function does nothing on Win32. The `mode' may
      be specified as an octal number, or in symbolic form
      `[ugoa]*['-=][rwxXstugo]+. See the man page for `chmod' for
      details.
    Options: 
        
       -r  Change permissions of all files in a directory recursively. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
       -f  Continue on errors. 
     
    - `cat'
      <<
           cat files...
      >>
    
    The `cat' function prints the contents of the files to stdout 
    - `test'
    `test' expression
    `[' expression +]+
    `[ --help'
    `[ --version'
    See the documentation for the `test' function (Section 9.7.1).
    
    - `find'
      <<
           find \emph{expression}
      >>
    
    See the documentation for the `find' function (Section 9.7.2).
 
  


Chapter 12    Build functions
*****************************


12.1  Builtin .PHONY targets
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  The complete set of builtin `.PHONY' targets include the following.
  
  
 .PHONY  Declares new phony targets (Section 7.12). 
 .DEFAULT  Declare the default build targets (Section 7.9). 
 .SUBDIRS  Include a directory as part of the project (Section 7.10). 
 .SCANNER  Define a dependency scanner (Section 7.10). 
 .INCLUDE  Include a file (Section 7.11). 
 .ORDER  Define a file-dependency ordering rule (Section 9.3.5). 
 .BUILD_BEGIN  Commands to be executed at the beginning of a build. 
 .BUILD_SUCCESS  Commands to be executed if the build is successful. 
 .BUILD_FAILURE  Commands to be executed if the build fails. 
  
    
  The `.BUILD' targets can be used to specify commands to be executed at
the beginning and end of the build. The `.BUILD_BEGIN' target is built
at the beginning of a project build, and one of `.BUILD_FAILURE' or
`.BUILD_SUCCESS' is executed when the build terminates.
  For example, the following set of rules simply print additional
messages about the status of the build.
<<
     .BUILD_BEGIN:
         echo Build starting
  
     .BUILD_SUCCESS:
         echo The build was successful
  
     .BUILD_FAILURE:
         println($"The build failed: $(length $(find-build-targets
Failed)) targets could not be built")
>>
  
  Another common use is to define notifications to be performed when the
build completes. For example, the following rule will create a new X
terminal displaying the summary of the build (see `BUILD_SUMMARY' in
Section 8.1.12).
<<
      .BUILD_FAILURE:
          xterm -e vi $(BUILD_SUMMARY)
>>
  
  If you do not wish to add these rules directly to your project (which
is probably a good idea if you work with others), you can define them in
your `.omakerc' (see Section A.8).
  The `find-build-targets' function (Section 12.8.0.9 is useful for
obtaining a firther summary of the build. Note that when output
diversions are in effect (with the `--divert-*' options --- see Chapter
A), any output produced by the commands is copied to a file. The name of
the file is specified by the `output-file' field of the `Target' object
(Section 11.1.11). You may find this useful in defining custom build
summaries.

12.2  Options and versioning
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=



12.2.0.1  OMakeFlags
--------------------
  
<<
     OMakeFlags(options)
        options : String
>>
  
  The `OMakeFlags' function is used to set `omake' options from within
OMakefiles. The options have exactly the same format as options on the
command line.
  For example, the following code displays the progress bar unless the
`VERBOSE' environment variable is defined.
<<
      if $(not $(defined-env VERBOSE))
          OMakeFlags(-S --progress)
          export
>>
  

12.2.0.2  OMakeVersion
----------------------
  
<<
     OMakeVersion(version1)
     OMakeVersion(version1, version2)
        version1, version2 : String
>>
  
  The `OMakeVersion' function is used for version checking in
OMakefiles. It takes one or two arguments.
  In the one argument form, if the omake version number is less than
`<version1>', then an exception is raised. In the two argument form, the
version must lie between `version1' and `version2'.
  

12.2.0.3  cmp-versions
----------------------
   
<<
     $(cmp-versions version1, version2)
        version1, version2 : String
>>
  
  The `cmp-versions\' functions can be used to compare arbitrary version
strings. It returns 0 when the two version strings are equal, a negative
number when the first string represents an earlier version, and a
positive number otherwise.

12.2.0.4  DefineCommandVars
---------------------------
  
<<
     DefineCommandVars()
>>
  
  The `DefineCommandVars' function redefines the variables passed on the
commandline. Variables definitions are passed on the command line in the
form `name=value'. This function is primarily for internal use by omake
to define these variables for the first time.

12.3  The OMakeroot file
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  The standard OMakeroot file defines the functions are rules for
building standard projects.
  

12.3.1  Variables
=================


12.3.1.1  ROOT
--------------
   The root directory of the current project.

12.3.1.2  CWD
-------------
   The current working directory (the directory is set for each
OMakefile in the project).

12.3.1.3  EMPTY
---------------
   The empty string.

12.3.1.4  STDROOT
-----------------
   The name of the standard installed OMakeroot file.

12.3.1.5  VERBOSE
-----------------
   Whether certain commands should be verbose (`false' by default).

12.3.1.6  ABORT_ON_COMMAND_ERROR
--------------------------------
   If set to true, the construction of a target should  be aborted
whenever one of the commands to build it fail. This defaults to true, 
and should normally be left that way.
  

12.3.1.7  SCANNER_MODE
----------------------
   This variable should be defined as one of four values  (defaults to
`enabled'). 
  
 enabled  Allow the use of default `.SCANNER' rules. Whenever a rule
   does  not specify a `:scanner:' dependency explicitly, try to find a 
   `.SCANNER' with the same target name. 
 disabled  Never use default `.SCANNER' rules. 
 warning  Allow the use of default `.SCANNER' rules, but print a warning
    whenever one is selected. 
 error  Do not allow the use of default `.SCANNER' rules. If a rule 
   does not specify a `:scanner:' dependency, and there is a default 
   `.SCANNER' rule, the build will terminate abnormally. 


12.3.2  System variables
========================
  
  

12.3.2.1  INSTALL
-----------------
   The command to install a program (`install' on `Unix', `cp' on

-----------------
   The normal path separator (`:' on `Unix', `;' on `Win32').

12.3.2.3  DIRSEP
----------------
   The normal directory separator (`/' on `Unix', `\' on `Win32').

12.3.2.4  EXT_LIB

on `Win32').

12.3.2.6  EXT_ASM
-----------------
   File suffix for an assembly file (default is `.s' on `Unix', and
`.asm' on `Win32').

12.3.2.7  EXE
-------------
   File suffix for executables (default is empty for `Unix', and `.exe'
on `Win32' and `Cygwin').

12.4  Building C programs
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  omake provides extensive support for building C programs.
  

12.4.1  C configuration variables
=================================
  
  The following variables can be redefined in your project.
  

12.4.1.1  CC
------------
   The name of the C compiler (on `Unix' it defaults to `gcc' when `gcc'
is present and  to `cc' otherwise; on `Win32' defaults to `cl /nologo').


12.4.1.2  CXX
-------------
   The name of the C++ compiler (on `Unix' it defaults to `gcc' when
`gcc' is present  and to `c'++ otherwise; on `Win32' defaults to `cl
/nologo').

12.4.1.3  CPP
-------------
   The name of the C preprocessor (defaults to `cpp' on `Unix', and `cl
/E' on `Win32').

12.4.1.4  CFLAGS
----------------
   Compilation flags to pass to the C compiler (default empty on `Unix',
and `/DWIN32'  on `Win32').

12.4.1.5  CXXFLAGS
------------------
   Compilation flags to pass to the C++ compiler (default empty on
`Unix', and `/DWIN32'  on `Win32').

12.4.1.6  INCLUDES
------------------
   Additional directories that specify the search path to the C and C++
compilers (default is `.').  The directories are passed to the C and C++
compilers with the `-I' option.  The include path with `-I' prefixes is
defined in the `PREFIXED_INCLUDES' variable.

12.4.1.7  LIBS
--------------
   Additional libraries needed when building a program (default is
empty).

12.4.1.8  AS
------------
   The name of the assembler (defaults to `as' on `Unix', and `ml' on
`Win32').

12.4.1.9  ASFLAGS

empty on `Win32').

12.4.1.15  LEX
--------------
   The name of the `lex' lexer generator (default is `lex' on `Unix',
empty on `Win32').

12.4.2  Generated C files
=========================
   Because the C scanners do not normally know anything about generated
source files (such as generated header files), these files may need to
be created before running the scanner.

12.4.2.1  CGeneratedFiles, LocalCGeneratedFiles
-----------------------------------------------
   
<<
  CGeneratedFiles(files)
  LocalCGeneratedFiles(files)
>>
  
  The `CGeneratedFiles' and `LocalCGeneratedFiles' functions specify
files that need to be generated before any C files are scanned for
dependencies. For example, if `config.h' and `inputs.h' are both
generated files, specify: 
<<
  CGeneratedFiles(config.h inputs.h)
>>
  
  The `CGeneratedFiles' function is global --- its arguments will be
generated before any C files anywhere in the project are scanned for
dependencies. The `LocalCGeneratedFiles' function follows the normal
scoping rules of OMake.
  

12.4.3  Building C programs and Libraries
=========================================


12.4.3.1  StaticCLibrary
------------------------
  
  The `StaticCLibrary' builds a static library.
  `StaticCLibrary(<target>, <files>)'
  The `<target>' does not include the library suffix, and The `<files>'
list does not include the object suffix. These are obtained from the
`EXT_LIB' and `EXT_OBJ' variables.
  This function returns the library filename.
  The following command builds the library `libfoo.a' from the files
`a.o b.o c.o' on `Unix', or the library `libfoo.lib' from the files
`a.obj b.obj c.obj' on `Win32'.
<<
  StaticCLibrary(libfoo, a b c)
  .DEFAULT: $(StaticCLibrary libbar, a b c d)
>>
  

12.4.3.2  StaticCLibraryCopy
----------------------------
  
  The `StaticCLibraryCopy' function copies the static library to an
install location.
  `StaticCLibraryCopy(<tag>, <dir>, <lib>)'
  The `<tag>' is the name of a target (typically a `.PHONY' target); the
`<dir>' is the installation directory, and `<lib>' is the library to be
copied (without the library suffix).
  This function returns the filename of the library in the target
directory.
  For example, the following code copies the library `libfoo.a' to the
`/usr/lib' directory.
<<
  .PHONY: install
  
  StaticCLibraryCopy(install, /usr/lib, libfoo)
>>
  

12.4.3.3  StaticCLibraryInstall
-------------------------------
  
  The `StaticCLibraryInstall' function builds a library, and sets the
install location in one step. It returns the filename of the library in
the target directory.
  `StaticCLibraryInstall(<tag>, <dir>, <libname>, <files>)'
<<
  StaticCLibraryInstall(install, /usr/lib, libfoo, a b c)
>>
  

12.4.3.4  StaticCObject, StaticCObjectCopy, StaticCObjectInstall
----------------------------------------------------------------
  
  These functions mirror the `StaticCLibrary', `StaticCLibraryCopy', and
`StaticCLibraryInstall' functions, but they build an object file (a `.o'
file on `Unix', and a `.obj' file on `Win32').

12.4.3.5  CProgram
------------------
  
  The `CProgram' function builds a C program from a set of object files
and libraries.
  `CProgram(<name>, <files>)'
  The `<name>' argument specifies the name of the program to be built;
the `<files>' argument specifies the files to be linked. The function
returns the filename of the executable.
  Additional options can be passed through the following variables. 
  
 CFLAGS  Flags used by the C compiler during the link step. 
 LDFLAGS  Flags to pass to the loader. 
 LIBS  Additional libraries to be linked. 
  
  For example, the following code specifies that the program `foo' is to
be produced by linking the files `bar.o' and `baz.o' and libraries
`libfoo.a'.
<<
  section
     LIBS = libfoo
     LDFLAGS += -lbar
     CProgram(foo, bar baz)
>>
  

12.4.3.6  CProgramCopy
----------------------
  
  The `CProgramCopy' function copies a file to an install location.
  `CProgramCopy(<tag>, <dir>, <program>)'
<<
  CProgramCopy(install, /usr/bin, foo)
>>
  

12.4.3.7  CProgramInstall
-------------------------
  
  The `CProgramInstall' function specifies a program to build, and a
location to install, simultaneously.
  `CProgramInstall(<tag>, <dir>, <name>, <files>)'
<<
  section
     LIBS = libfoo
     LDFLAGS += -lbar
     CProgramInstall(install, /usr/bin, foo, bar baz)
>>
  

12.4.3.8  CXXProgram, CXXProgramInstall
---------------------------------------
  
  The `CXXProgram' and `CXXProgramInstall' functions are equivalent to
their C counterparts, except that would use `$(CXX)' and `$(CXXFLAGS)'
for linking instead of `$(CC)' and `$(CFLAGS)'.

12.5  Building OCaml programs
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  

12.5.1  Autoconfiguration variables for OCaml programs
======================================================
   These variables will get defined based on the ``autoconf-style''
tests executed when you run OMakefor the first time. You can use them to
configure your project accordingly, and you should not redefine them.

12.5.1.1  OCAMLOPT_EXISTS
-------------------------
   True when `ocamlopt' (or `ocamlopt.opt') is  available on your
machine.

12.5.1.2  OCAMLFIND_EXISTS
--------------------------
   True when the ocamlfind is available on your  machines.

12.5.1.3  OCAMLDEP_MODULES_AVAILABLE
------------------------------------
   True when a version of  `ocamldep' that understands the `-modules'
option is available on your machine.

12.5.1.4  MENHIR_AVAILABLE
--------------------------
   True when the Menhir parser-generator is available  on your machine.
  

12.5.2  Configuration variables for OCaml programs
==================================================
  
  The following variables can be redefined in your project.

12.5.2.1  USE_OCAMLFIND
-----------------------
   Whether to use the `ocamlfind' utility (default `false\')

12.5.2.2  OCAMLC
----------------
   The OCaml bytecode compiler (default `ocamlc.opt' if it exists  and
`USE_OCAMLFIND' is not set, otherwise `ocamlc').

12.5.2.3  OCAMLOPT
------------------
   The OCaml native-code compiler (default `ocamlopt.opt' if it  exists
and `USE_OCAMLFIND' is not set, otherwise `ocamlopt').

12.5.2.4  CAMLP4
----------------
   The `camlp4' preprocessor (default `camlp4').

12.5.2.5  OCAMLLEX
------------------
   The OCaml lexer generator (default `ocamllex').

12.5.2.6  OCAMLLEXFLAGS
-----------------------
   The flags to pass to `ocamllex' (default `-q').

12.5.2.7  OCAMLYACC
-------------------
   The OCaml parser generator (default `ocamlyacc').

12.5.2.8  OCAMLYACCFLAGS
------------------------
   Additional options to pass to `$(OCAMLYACC)'.

12.5.2.9  OCAMLDEP
------------------
   The OCaml dependency analyzer (default `ocamldep').

12.5.2.10  OCAMLDEP_MODULES
---------------------------
   The OCaml dependency analyzer that understands the  `-module' option
(default `ocamldep', if `ocamldep -modules' works, or  `ocamlrun
ocamldep-omake', if `ocamlrun ocamldep-omake -modules' works, and empty 
when neither works).

12.5.2.11  OCAMLDEP_MODULES_ENABLED
-----------------------------------
   Instead of using `OCAMLDEP'  in a traditional `make'-style fashion,
run `$(OCAMLDEP_MODULES) -modules' and then  postprocess the output
internally to discover all the relevant generated `.ml' and  `.mli'
files. See Section 12.6 for more information on  interactions between
OMake, `OCAMLDEP' and generated files. This feature is currently 
considered highly experimental and is disabled by default.

12.5.2.12  OCAMLMKTOP
---------------------
   The OCaml toploop compiler (default `ocamlmktop').

12.5.2.13  OCAMLLINK

   The OCaml native-code linker (default `$(OCAMLOPT)').

12.5.2.15  OCAMLINCLUDES
------------------------
   Search path to pass to the OCaml compilers (default `.').  The search
path with the `-I' prefix is defined by the `PREFIXED_OCAMLINCLUDES' 
variable.

12.5.2.16  OCAMLFIND
--------------------
   The `ocamlfind' utility (default `ocamlfind' if  `USE_OCAMLFIND' is
set, otherwise empty).

12.5.2.17  OCAMLFINDFLAGS
-------------------------
   The flags to pass to `ocamlfind' (default empty, `USE_OCAMLFIND' must
be set).

12.5.2.18  OCAMLPACKS
---------------------
   Package names to pass to `ocamlfind' (`USE_OCAMLFIND' must be set).

12.5.2.19  BYTE_ENABLED
-----------------------
   Flag indicating whether to use the bytecode compiler (default `true',
when no `ocamlopt' found, `false' otherwise).

12.5.2.20  NATIVE_ENABLED
-------------------------
   Flag indicating whether to use the native-code compiler (default
`true', when ocamlopt is found, `false' otherwise).  Both `BYTE_ENABLED'
and `NATIVE_ENABLED' can be set to true;  at least one should be set to
true.

12.5.2.21  MENHIR_ENABLED
-------------------------
   Define this as `true' if you wish to use  `menhir' instead of
`ocamlyacc' (default `false').

12.5.3  OCaml command flags
===========================
  
  The following variables specify additional options to be passed to the
OCaml tools.

12.5.3.1  OCAMLDEPFLAGS
-----------------------
   Flags to pass to `OCAMLDEP' (but not to `OCAMLDEP_MODULES').

   Flags to pass to the byte-code compiler (default `-g').

12.5.3.4  OCAMLOPTFLAGS
-----------------------
   Flags to pass to the native-code compiler (default empty).

12.5.3.5  OCAMLFLAGS
--------------------
   Flags to pass to either compiler (default `-warn-error A').

12.5.3.6  OCAML_BYTE_LINK_FLAGS
-------------------------------
   Flags to pass to the byte-code linker (default empty).

12.5.3.7  OCAML_NATIVE_LINK_FLAGS
---------------------------------
   Flags to pass to the native-code linker (default empty).

12.5.3.8  OCAML_LINK_FLAGS
--------------------------
   Flags to pass to either linker.

12.5.3.9  MENHIR_FLAGS
----------------------
   Additional flags to pass to `menhir'.

12.5.4  Library variables
=========================
  
  The following variables are used during linking.
  

12.5.4.1  OCAML_LIBS
--------------------
   Libraries to pass to the linker. These libraries become dependencies 
of the link step.

12.5.4.2  OCAML_OTHER_LIBS
--------------------------
   Additional libraries to pass to the linker. These libraries are  not
included as dependencies to the link step. Typical use is for the OCaml 
standard libraries like `unix' or `str'.

12.5.4.3  OCAML_CLIBS
---------------------
   C libraries to pass to the linker.

12.5.4.4  OCAML_LIB_FLAGS
-------------------------
   Extra flags for the library.

12.6  Generated OCaml Files
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

    As of OCaml version 3.09.2, the standard `ocamldep' scanner is
``broken''. The main issue is that it finds only those dependencies that
already exist. If `foo.ml' contains a dependency on `Bar', 
<<
  foo.ml:
     open Bar
>>
  then the default `ocamldep' will only find the dependency if a file
`bar.ml' or `bar.ml' exists in the include path. It will not find (or
print) the dependency if, for example, only `bar.mly' exists at the time
`ocamldep' is run, even though `bar.ml' and `bar.mli' can be generated
from `bar.mly'.
  OMake currently provides two methods for addressing this problem ---
one that requires manually specifying the generated files, and an
experimental method for discovering such ``hidden'' dependencies
automatically. The variable `OCAMLDEP_MODULES_ENABLED' 12.5.2.11
controls which method is going to be used. When this variable is false,
the manual specifications are expected and when it is true, the
automated discovery will be attempted.
  

12.6.0.5  OCamlGeneratedFiles, LocalOCamlGeneratedFiles
-------------------------------------------------------
   
<<
  OCamlGeneratedFiles(files)
  LocalOCamlGeneratedFiles(files)
>>
  
  When the `OCAMLDEP_MODULES_ENABLED' 12.5.2.11 variable is set to
`false', the `OCamlGeneratedFiles' and `LocalOCamlGeneratedFiles'
functions specify files that need to be generated before any OCaml files
are scanned for dependencies. For example, if `parser.ml' and `lexer.ml'
are both generated files, specify: 
<<
  OCamlGeneratedFiles(parser.ml lexer.ml)
>>
  
  The `OCamlGeneratedFiles' function is global --- its arguments will be
generated before any OCaml files anywhere in the project are scanned for
dependencies. The `LocalOCamlGeneratedFiles' function follows the normal
scoping rules of OMake.
  These functions have no effect when `OCAMLDEP_MODULES_ENABLED'
12.5.2.11 is true.
  

12.6.0.6  Automatic discovery of generated files during dependency
------------------------------------------------------------------
analysis.
---------
   Having to specify the generated files manualy when OMake could
discover them automatically is obviously suboptimal. To address this, we
try to use a custom `ocamldep' that only finds the free module names in
a file. 
  This functionality is experimental and is disabled by default for now.
Set `OCAMLDEP_MODULES_ENABLED' 12.5.2.11 to `true' (or to
`$(OCAMLDEP_MODULES_AVAILABLE)' in your project to enable it.
  Note that the experimental `ocamldep' functionality this relies upon
is not yet included in the standard OCaml --- see
http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4047. Temporarily, we distribute
a bytecode version `ocamldep-omake' of the appropriately modified
`ocamldep'. The appropriate `ocamldep' will be discovered automatically
--- see Sections 12.5.1.3 and 12.5.2.10.

12.6.1  Using the Menhir parser generator
=========================================
  
  Menhir is a parser generator that is mostly compatible with
`ocamlyacc', but with many improvements. A few of these are listed here
(excerpted from the Menhir home page
http://cristal.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/).
  
  
 - Menhir's explanations are believed to be understandable by mere
   humans. 
 - Menhir allows grammar specifications to be split over multiple files.
    It also allows several grammars to share a single set of tokens. 
 - Menhir is able to produce parsers that are parameterized by Objective
   Caml modules. 
 - Added by jyh With the `--infer' option, Menhir can typecheck the
   semantic actions  in your grammar at generation time. 
  
  What do you need to do to use Menhir instead of `ocamlyacc'? 
  
 1. Place the following definition before the relevant section of your
   project  (or at the top of your project `OMakefile' if you want to
   use Menhir everywhere).
   <<
        MENHIR_ENABLED = true
   >>
 
 
 2. Optionally, add any desired Menhir options to the `MENHIR_FLAGS'
   variable.
   <<
        MENHIR_FLAGS += --infer
   >>
  
  With this setup, any file with a `.mly' suffix will be compiled with
Menhir.
  If your grammar is split across several files, you need to specify it
explicitly, using the `MenhirMulti' function.
<<
      MenhirMulti(target, sources)
          target : filename, without suffix
          sources : the files that define the grammar, without suffixes
>>
  
  For example, if you want to generate the parser files `parse.ml' and
`parse.mli', from the grammar specified in files `a.mly' and `b.mly',
you would use the following.
<<
      MenhirMulti(parse, a b)
>>
  

12.6.1.1  OCamlLibrary
----------------------
  
  The `OCamlLibrary' function builds an OCaml library.
  `OCamlLibrary(<libname>, <files>)'
  The `<libname>' and `<files>' are listed without suffixes.
  

12.6.1.2  ABORT_ON_DEPENDENCY_ERRORS
------------------------------------
    The linker requires that the files to be  listed in dependency
order. If this variable is true, the order of  the files is determined
by the command line, but omake will  abort with an error message if the
order is illegal. Otherwise,  the files are sorted automatically.
  This function returns the list of all the targets that it defines the
rules for (including the `$(name)$(EXT_LIB)' file when `NATIVE_ENABLED'
is set).
  The following code builds the `libfoo.cmxa' library from the files
`foo.cmx' and `bar.cmx' (if `NATIVE_ENABLED' is set), and `libfoo.cma'
from `foo.cmo' and `bar.cmo' (if `BYTE_ENABLED' is set).
<<
  OCamlLibrary(libfoo, foo bar)
>>
  

12.6.1.3  OCamlPackage
----------------------
  
  The `OCamlPackage' function builds an OCaml package.
  `OCamlPackage(<name>, <files>)'
  The `<name>' and `<files>' are listed without suffixes. The `<files>'
must have been compiled with the `-for-pack <ident>' flag to the OCaml
compiler.
  This function returns the list of all the targets that it defines the
rules for (including the `$(name)$(EXT_LIB)' file when `NATIVE_ENABLED'
is set).
  The following code builds the `libfoo.cmx' package from the files
`package.cmx' and `bar.cmx' (if `NATIVE_ENABLED' is set), and
`package.cmo' from `foo.cmo' and `bar.cmo' (if `BYTE_ENABLED' is set).
<<
  OCamlPackage(package, foo bar)
>>
  

12.6.1.4  OCamlLibraryCopy
--------------------------
  
  The `OCamlLibraryCopy' function copies a library to an install
location.
  `OCamlLibraryCopy(<tag>, <libdir>, <libname>, <interface-files>)'
  The `<interface-files>' specify additional interface files to be
copied if the `INSTALL_INTERFACES' variable is true.

12.6.1.5  OCamlLibraryInstall
-----------------------------
  
  The `OCamlLibraryInstall' function builds a library and copies it to
an install location in one step.
  `OCamlLibraryInstall(<tag>, <libdir>, <libname>, <files>)'

12.6.1.6  OCamlProgram
----------------------
  
  The `OCamlProgram' function builds an OCaml program. It returns the
array with all the targets for which it has defined the rules
(`$(name)$(EXE)' and `$(name).run' and/or `$(name).opt', depending on
the `NATIVE_ENABLED' and `BYTE_ENABLED' variables).
  `OCamlProgram(<name>, <files>)'
  Additional variables used: 
  
 OCAML_LIBS 12.5.4.1  Additional libraries passed to the linker, without
   suffix. These files  become dependencies of the target program. 
 OCAML_OTHER_LIBS 12.5.4.2  Additional libraries passed to the linker,
   without suffix. These  files do not become dependencies of the target
   program. 
 OCAML_CLIBS 12.5.4.3  C libraries to pass to the linker. 
 OCAML_BYTE_LINK_FLAGS 12.5.3.6  Flags to pass to the bytecode linker. 
 OCAML_NATIVE_LINK_FLAGS 12.5.3.7  Flags to pass to the native code

12.7  Building LaTeX programs
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  

12.7.1  Configuration variables
===============================
  
  The following variables can be modified in your project.

12.7.1.1  LATEX
---------------
   The LaTeX command (default `latex').

12.7.1.2  TETEX2_ENABLED
------------------------
   Flag indicating whether to use advanced LaTeX options present in
TeTeX v.2 (default value is determined the first time omake reads
`LaTeX.src' and depends on the version of LaTeX you have installed).

12.7.1.3  LATEXFLAGS
--------------------
   The LaTeX flags (defaults depend on the `TETEX2_ENABLED' variable)

12.7.1.4  BIBTEX
----------------
   The BibTeX command (default `bibtex').

12.7.1.5  MAKEINDEX
-------------------
   The command to build an index (default `makeindex').

12.7.1.6  DVIPS
---------------
   The `.dvi' to PostScript converter (default `dvips').

12.7.1.7  DVIPSFLAGS
--------------------
   Flags to pass to `dvips' (default `-t letter').

12.7.1.8  DVIPDFM
-----------------
   The `.dvi' to `.pdf' converter (default `dvipdfm').

12.7.1.9  DVIPDFMFLAGS
----------------------
   Flags to pass to `dvipdfm' (default `-p letter').

12.7.1.10  PDFLATEX
-------------------
   The `.latex' to `.pdf' converter (default `pdflatex').

12.7.1.11  PDFLATEXFLAGS
------------------------
   Flags to pass to pdflatex (default is empty).

12.7.1.12  USEPDFLATEX
----------------------
   Flag indicating whether to use pdflatex instead of dvipdfm to
generate the `.pdf' document (default `false').

12.7.2  Building LaTeX documents
================================


12.7.2.1  LaTeXDocument
-----------------------
  
  The `LaTeXDocument' produces a LaTeX document.
  `LaTeXDocument(<name>, <texfiles>)'
  The document `<name>' and `<texfiles>' are listed without suffixes.
This function returns the filenames for the generated `.ps' and `.pdf'
files.
  Additional variables used:

12.7.2.2  TEXINPUTS
-------------------
   The LaTeX search path (an array of directories, default is  taken
from the `TEXINPUTS' environment variable).

12.7.2.3  TEXDEPS
-----------------
   Additional files this document depends on.

12.7.2.4  TeXGeneratedFiles, LocalTeXGeneratedFiles
---------------------------------------------------
   
<<
  TeXGeneratedFiles(files)
  LocalTeXGeneratedFiles(files)
>>
  
  The `TeXGeneratedFiles' and `LocalTeXGeneratedFiles' functions specify
files that need to be generated before any LaTeXfiles are scanned for
dependencies. For example, if `config.tex' and `inputs.tex' are both
generated files, specify: 
<<
      TeXGeneratedFiles(config.tex inputs.tex)
>>
  
  The `TeXGeneratedFiles' function is global --- its arguments will be
generated before any TeX files anywhere in the project are scanned for
dependencies. The `LocalTeXGeneratedFiles' function follows the normal
scoping rules of OMake.
  

12.7.2.5  LaTeXDocumentCopy
---------------------------
  
  The `LaTeXDocumentCopy' copies the document to an install location.
  `LaTeXDocumentCopy(<tag>, <libdir>, <installname>, <docname>)'
  This function copies just the `.pdf' and `.ps' files.

12.7.2.6  LaTeXDocumentInstall
------------------------------
  
  The `LaTeXDocumentInstall' builds a document and copies it to an
install location in one step.
  `LaTeXDocumentInstall(<tag>, <libdir>, <installname>, <docname>,
<files>)'

12.8  Examining the dependency graph
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=



12.8.0.7  dependencies, dependencies-all
----------------------------------------
  
<<
     $(dependencies targets) : File Array
     $(dependencies-all targets) : File Array
     $(dependencies-proper targets) : File Array
        targets : File Array
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `dependencies' function returns the set of immediate dependencies
of the given targets. This function can only be used within a rule body
and all the arguments to the `dependency' function must also be
dependencies of this rule. This restriction ensures that all the
dependencies are known when this function is executed.
  The `dependencies-all' function is similar, but it expands the
dependencies recursively, returning all of the dependencies of a target,
not just the immediate ones.
  The `dependencies-proper' function returns all recursive dependencies,
except the dependencies that are leaf targets. A leaf target is a target
that has no dependencies and no build commands; a leaf target
corresponds to a source file in the current project.
  In all three functions, files that are not part of the current project
are silently discarded.
  One purpose of the `dependencies-proper' function is for ``clean''
targets. For example, one way to delete all intermediate files in a
build is with a rule that uses the `dependencies-proper'. Note however,
that the rule requires building the project before it can be deleted.
For a shorter form, see the `filter-proper-targets' function.
<<
      .PHONY: clean
  
      APP = ...     # the name of the target application
      clean: $(APP)
         rm $(dependencies-proper $(APP))
>>
  
  

12.8.0.8  target
----------------
   
<<
     $(target targets) : Target Array
        targets : File Sequence
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `target' function returns the Target object associated with each
of the targets. See the `Target' object for more information.

12.8.0.9  find-build-targets
----------------------------
  
<<
      $(build-targets tag) : Target Array
         tag : Succeeded | Failed
>>
  
  The `build-targets' allow the results of the build to be examined. The
`tag' must specifies which targets are to be returned; the comparison is
case-insensitive.
  
  
 Succeeded  The list of targets that were built successfully. 
 Failed  The list of targets that could not be built. 
  
  These are used mainly in conjuction with the `.BUILD_SUCCESS' (Section
12.1) and `.BUILD_FAILURE' (Section 12.1) phony targets. For example,
adding the following to your project `OMakefile' will print the number
of targets that failed (if the build failed).
<<
      .BUILD_FAILURE:
          echo "Failed target count: $(length $(failed-targets))"
>>
  

12.8.0.10  project-directories
------------------------------
  
<<
     $(project-directories) : Dir Array
>>
  
  The `project-directories' function returns the list of all directories
that are considered to be part of the project.
  To get the complete directory list, this function should be called
from within a rule body.

12.8.0.11  rule
---------------
  
  The `rule' function is called whenever a build rule is defined. It is
unlikely that you will need to redefine this function, except in very
exceptional cases.
<<
     rule(multiple, target, pattern, sources, options, body) : Rule
        multiple : String
        target   : Sequence
        pattern  : Sequence
        sources  : Sequence
        options  : Array
        body     : Body
>>
  
  The `rule' function is called when a rule is evaluated.
  
  
 multiple  A Boolean value indicating whether the rule was defined  with
   a double colon `::'. 
 target  The sequence of target names. 
 pattern  The sequence of patterns. This sequence will be empty  for
   two-part rules. 
 sources  The sequence of dependencies. 
 options  An array of options. Each option is represented  as a `Map'
   (Section 11.1.2) associating each specified option with  a value. 
 body  The body expression of the rule. 
  
  Consider the following rule.
<<
     target: pattern: sources :name1: option1 :name2: option2
        expr1
        expr2
>>
  
  This expression represents the following function call, where square
brackets are used to indicate arrays, and the curly brackets represent a
`Map' (Section 11.1.2).
<<
     rule(false, target, pattern, sources,
          { $|:name1:| = option1; $|:name2:| = option2 }
          [expr1; expr2])
>>


Chapter 13    The OSH shell
***************************
    
  OMake also includes a standalone command-line interpreter osh that can
be used as an interactive shell. The shell uses the same syntax, and
provides the same features on all platforms omake supports, including
Win32.
  

13.1  Startup
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  On startup, osh reads the file `~/.oshrc' if it exists. The syntax of
this file is the same as an OMakefile. The following additional
variables are significant.
  

13.1.1  prompt
==============
   The `prompt' variable specifies the command-line prompt. It can be a
simple string.
<<
      prompt = osh>
>>
  
  Or you may choose to define it as a function of no arguments.
<<
      prompt() =
          return $"<$(USER):$(HOST) $(homename $(CWD))>"
>>
  
  An example of the latter prompt is as follows.
<<
      <jyh:kenai.yapper.org ~>cd links/omake
      <jyh:kenai.yapper.org ~/links/omake>
>>
  
  

13.1.2  ignoreeof
=================
    If the `ignoreeof' is `true', then `osh' will not exit on  a
terminal end-of-file (usually `^D' on Unix systems).
  

13.2  Aliases
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Command aliases are defined by adding functions to the `Shell.'
object. The following alias adds the `-AF' option to the `ls' command.
<<
      Shell. +=
         ls(argv) =
            "ls" -AF $(argv)
>>
  
  Quoted commands do not undergo alias expansion. The quotation `"ls"'
prevents the alias from being recursive.
  

13.3  Interactive syntax
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  The interactive syntax in `osh' is the same as the syntax of an
`OMakefile', with one exception in regard to indentation. The line
before an indented block must have a colon at the end of the line. A
block is terminated with a `.' on a line by itself, or `^D'. In the
following example, the first line `if true' has no body, because there
is no colon.
<<
     # The following if has no body
     osh>if true
     # The following if has a body
     osh>if true:
     if>       if true:
     if>          println(Hello world)
     if>          .
     Hello world
>>
  
  Note that `osh' makes some effort to modify the prompt while in an
indented body, and it auto-indents the text.
  The colon signifier is also allowed in files, although it is not
required.

A.1  General usage
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  For Boolean options (for example, `-s', `--progress', etc.) the option
can include a prefix `--no-', which inverts the usual sense of the
option. For example, the option `--progress' means ``print a progress
bar,'' while the option `--no-progress' means ``do not print a progress
bar.''
  If multiple instances of an option are specified, the final option
determines the behavior of OMake. In the following command line, the
final `--no-S' cancels the earlier `-S'.
<<
      % omake -S --progress --no-S
>>
  
  

A.2  Output control
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  

A.2.1  -s
=========
   `-s'
  Do not print commands as they are executed (be ``silent'').
  

A.2.2  -S
=========
   `-S'
  Do not print commands as they are executed unless they produce output
and/or fail.
  

A.2.3  -w
=========
   `-w'
  Print directory information in make format as commands are executed.
This is mainly useful for editors that expect make-style directory
information for determining the location of errors.
  

A.2.4  --progress
=================
   `--progress'
  Print a progress indicator. This is normally used with the -s or -S
options.
  

A.2.5  --print-status
=====================
   `--print-status'
  Print status lines (the `+' and `-' lines).
  

A.2.6  --print-exit
===================
   `--print-exit'
  Print termination codes when commands complete.
  

A.2.7  --divert-errors
======================
   `--divert-errors'
  ``Divert'' command output. The effect of this option to save the
output of any commands so that it can be printed at the end of the
build. If any rules/commands fail, then OMake will re-print the output
of the failed commands when it finishes the build. Off by default.
  

A.2.8  --divert-repeat
======================
   `--divert-repeat'
  When a rule finishes, print the output as a single block. This is
useful in combination `-j' option (see Section A.3.12), where the output
of multiple subprocesses can be garbled. The diversion is printed as a
single coherent unit. Implies `--divert-errors'.
  

A.2.9  --divert-only
====================
   `--divert-only' 
  Print diversions only. This forces OMake to be much more quiet,
printing output only when a command produces output. With this option
alone, the output from successful commands is echoed immediately, and
the output from failed commands is delayed until the build completes and
the summary is printed. May be used in combination with
`--divert-repeat' (output from failed commands will be printed twice).
Implies `--divert-errors'.
  You might also consider using the `--progress' flag (see Section
A.2.4) so that you can see when the build is active.
  

A.2.10  --divert-discard-success
================================
   `--divert-discard-success'
  Discard the output from commands that were successful. This can be
useful in reducing unwanted output so that you can concentrate on any
errors.
  

A.2.11  -o
==========
   `-o [01jwWpPxXsS]'
  For brevity, the `-o' option is also provided to duplicate the above
output options. The `-o' option takes a argument consisting of a
sequence of characters. The characters are read from left-to-right; each
specifies a set of output options. In general, an uppercase character
turns the option on; a lowercase character turns the option off.
  
  
 0  Equivalent to `-s --divert-only --divert-discard-success'
 This option specifies that `omake' should be as quiet as possible. If
   any errors occur during the build, the output is delayed until the
   build terminates. Output from successful commands is discarded.
 
 1  Equivalent to `-S --progress --divert-only --divert-repeat
   --divert-discard-success'
 This is a slightly more relaxed version of ``quiet'' output. The output
   from successful commands is discarded. The output from failed
   commands is printed immediately after the command complete. The
   output from failed commands is displayed twice: once immediately
   after the command completes, and again when the build completes. A
   progress bar is displayed so that you know when the build is active.
   Include the ``p'' option if you want to turn off the progress bar
   (for example `omake -o 1p').
 
 2  Equivalent to `--progress --divert-only --divert-repeat'
 The is even more relaxed, output from successful commands is printed.
   This is often useful for deinterleaving the output when using `-j'.
 
 W  Equivalent to `-w' 
 w  Equivalent to `--no-w' 
 P  Equivalent to `--progress' 
 p  Equivalent to `--no-progress' 
 X  Equivalent to `--print-exit' 
 x  Equivalent to `--no-print-exit' 
 S  Equivalent to `-S' 
 s  Equivalent to `--no-S' 
  
  

A.3  Build options
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  

A.3.1  -k
=========
   `-k'
  Do not abort when a build command fails; continue to build as much of
the project as possible.
  

A.3.2  -n
=========
   `-n'
  This can be used to see what would happen if the project were to be
built.
  

A.3.3  -p
=========
   `-p'
  Watch the filesystem for changes, and continue the build until it
succeeds. If this option is specified, omake will restart the build
whenever source files are modified. Implies -k.
  

A.3.4  -P
=========
   `-P'
  Watch the filesystem for changes forever. If this option is specified,
omake will restart the build whenever source files are modified. Implies
-k.
  

A.3.5  -R
=========
   `-R'
  Ignore the current directory and build the project from its root
directory. When omake is run in a subdirectory of a project, it normally
builds files within the current directory and its subdirectories. If the
-R option is specified, the build is performed as if omake were run in
the project root.
  

A.3.6  -t
=========
   `-t'
  Update the omake database to force the project to be considered
up-to-date.
  

A.3.7  -U
=========
   `-U'
  Do not trust cached build information. This will force the entire
project to be rebuilt.
  

A.3.8  --depend
===============
   `--depend'
  Do not trust cached dependency information. This will force files to
be rescanned for dependency information.
  

A.3.9  --configure
==================
   `--configure'
  Re-run `static.' sections of the included omake files, instead of
trusting the cached results.
  

A.3.10  --force-dotomake
========================
   `--force-dotomake'
  Always use the `$HOME/.omake' for the `.omc' cache files.
  

A.3.11  --dotomake
==================
   `--dotomake <dir>'
  Use the specified directory instead of the `$HOME/.omake' for the
placement of the `.omc' cache files.
  

A.3.12  -j
==========
   `-j <count>'
  Run multiple build commands in parallel. The count specifies a bound
on the number of commands to run simultaneously. In addition, the count
may specify servers for remote execution of commands in the form
`server=count'. For example, the option `-j
2:small.host.org=1:large.host.org=4' would specify that up to 2 jobs can
be executed locally, 1 on the server `small.host.org' and 4 on
`large.host.org'. Each remote server must use the same filesystem
location for the project.
  Remote execution is currently an experimental feature. Remote
filesystems like NFS do not provide adequate file consistency for this
to work.
  

A.3.13  --print-dependencies
============================
   `--print-dependencies'
  Print dependency information for the targets on the command line.
  

A.3.14  --show-dependencies
===========================
   `--show-dependencies <target>'
  Print dependency information if the `target' is built.
  

A.3.15  --all-dependencies
==========================
   `--all-dependencies'
  If either of the options --print-dependencies or --show-dependencies
is in effect, print transitive dependencies. That is, print all
dependencies recursively. If neither option --print-dependencies,
--show-dependencies is specified, this option has no effect.
  

A.3.16  --verbose-dependencies
==============================
   `--verbose-dependencies'
  If either of the options --print-dependencies or --show-dependencies
is in effect, also print listings for each dependency. The output is
very verbose, consider redirecting to a file. If neither option
--print-dependencies, --show-dependencies is specified, this option has
no effect.
  

A.3.17  --install
=================
   `--install'
  Install default files OMakefile and OMakeroot into the current
directory. You would typically do this to start a project in the current
directory.
  

A.3.18  --install-all
=====================
   `--install-all'
  In addition to installing files OMakefile and OMakeroot, install
default OMakefiles into each subdirectory of the current directory.
cvs(1) rules are used for filtering the subdirectory list. For example,
OMakefiles are not copied into directories called `CVS', `RCCS', etc.
  

A.3.19  --install-force
=======================
   `--install-force'
  Normally, omake will prompt before it overwrites any existing
OMakefile. If this option is given, all files are forcibly overwritten
without prompting.
  

A.3.20  --absname
=================
   `--absname'
  Filenames should expand to absolute pathnames.
  N.B. This is an experimental option. It may become deprecated.
  

A.3.21  variable definition
===========================
   `name=[value]'
  omake variables can also be defined on the command line in the form
`name=value'. For example, the `CFLAGS' variable might be defined on the
command line with the argument `CFLAGS="-Wall -g"'.
  

A.4  Additional options
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  In addition, omake supports a number of debugging flags on the command
line. Run `omake --help' to get a summary of these flags.
  

A.5  Environment variables
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  

A.5.1  OMAKEFLAGS
=================
   
  If defines, the `OMAKEFLAGS' should specify a set of options exactly
as they are specified on the command line.
  

A.5.2  OMAKELIB
===============
   
  If defined, the `OMAKELIB' environment variable should refer to the
installed location of the OMake standard library. This is the directory
that contains `Pervasives.om' etc. On a Unix system, this is often
`/usr/lib/omake' or `/usr/local/lib/omake', and on Win32 systems it is
often `c:\Program Files\OMake\lib'.
  If not defined, `omake' uses the default configured location. You
should normally leave this unset.
  

A.6  Functions
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  

A.6.1  OMakeFlags
=================
  
  The `OMakeFlags' function can be used within an `OMakefile' to modify
the set of options. The options should be specified exactly as they are
on the command line. For example, if you want some specific project to
be silent and display a progress bar, you can add the following line to
your `OMakefile'.
<<
      OMakeFlags(-S --progress)
>>
  
  For options where it makes sense, the options are scoped like
variables. For example, if you want OMake to be silent for a single rule
(instead of for the entire project), you can use scoping the restrict
the range of the option.
<<
      section
          # Do not display command output when foo is constructed
          OMakeFlags(-S)
  
          foo: fee
             echo "This is a generated file" > foo
             cat fee >> foo
             chmod 555 foo
>>
  
  

A.7  Option processing
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  When `omake' is invoked, the options are processed in the following
order.
  
  
 1. All options specified by the `OMAKEFLAGS' environment variable are
   defined globally. 
 2. All options from the command line are defined globally. 
 3. Any individual calls the the `OMakeFlags' function modify the
   options locally. 
  
  

A.8  .omakerc
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

    
  If the `$(HOME)/.omakerc' exists, it is read before any of the
`OMakefiles' in your project. The `.omakerc' file is frequently used for
user-specific customization. For example, instead of defining the
`OMAKEFLAGS' environment variable, you could add a line to your
`.omakerc'.
<<
      $(HOME)/.omakerc:
          # My private options
          OMakeFlags(-S --progress)
>>
  


Appendix B    OMake grammar
***************************
    
  

B.1  OMake lexical conventions
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  The OMake language is based on the language for GNU/BSD make, where
there are few lexical conventions. Strictly speaking, there are no
keywords, and few special symbols.
  

B.1.1  Comments
===============
  
  Comments begin with the `#' character and continue to the end-of-line.
Text within a comment is unrestricted.
  Examples.
<<
     # This is a comment
     # This $comment contains a quote " character
>>
  
  

B.1.2  Special characters
=========================
  
  The following characters are special in some contexts.
<<
     $    (    )    ,    .   =    :    "    '    `    \    #
>>
  
  
  
 - `$' is used to denote a variable reference, or function application. 
 - Parentheses `)', `(' are argument deliminters. 
 - The command `,' is an argument separator. 
 - The period symbol `.' is a name separator. 
 - The equality symbol `=' denotes a definition. 
 - The colon symbol `:' is used to denote rules, and (optionally) to
   indicate  that an expression is followed by an indented body. 
 - The quotation symbols `"' and `'' delimit character strings. 
 - The symbol `#' is the first character of a constant. 
 - The escape symbol `\' is special only when followed by another
   special  character. In this case, the special status of the second
   character is removed,  and the sequence denotes the second character.
   Otherwise, the `\' is not special.
 Examples:
 
      
    - `\$': the `$' character (as a normal character).  
    - `\#': the `#' character (as a normal character).  
    - `\\': the `\' character (as a normal character).  
    - `c\:\Windows\moo\#boo': the string `c:\Windows\moo#boo'.  
  
  
  

B.1.3  Identifiers
==================
  
  Identifiers (variable names) are drawn from the ASCII alphanumeric
characters as well as `_', `-', `~', `@'. Case is significant; the
following identifiers are distinct: `FOO', `Foo', `foo'. The identifier
may begin with any of the valid characters, including digits.
  Using `egrep' notation, the regular expression for identifiers is
defined as follows.
<<
      identifier ::= [-@~_A-Za-z0-9]+
>>
  
  The following are legal identifiers.
<<
      Xyz    hello_world    seventy@nine
      79-32  Gnus~Gnats     CFLAGS
>>
  
  The following are not legal identifiers.
<<
      x+y    hello&world
>>
  
  

B.1.4  Command identifiers
==========================
  
  The following words have special significance when they occur as the
first word of a program line. They are not otherwise special.
<<
      case     catch  class    declare    default
      do       else   elseif   export     extends
      finally  if     import   include    match
      open     raise  return   section    switch
      try      value  when     while
>>
  
  

B.1.5  Variable references
==========================
  
  A variable reference is denoted with the `$' special character
followed by an identifier. If the identifier name has more than one
character, it must be enclosed in parentheses. The parenthesized version
is most common. The following are legal variable references.
<<
      $(Xyz)    $(hello_world)   $(seventy@nine)
      $(79-32)  $(Gnus~Gnats)    $(CFLAGS)
>>
  
  Single-character references also include several additional
identifiers, including `&*<^?]['. The following are legal
single-character references.
<<
     $@   $&   $*   $<   $^   $+   $?   $[   $]
     $A   $_   $a   $b   $x   $1   $2   $3
>>
  
  Note that a non-parenthesized variable reference is limited to a
single character, even if it is followed by additional legal identifier
charqcters. Suppose the value of the `$x' variable is 17. The following
examples illustrate evaluation.
<<
      $x           evaluates to    17
      foo$xbar     evaluates to    foo17bar
      foo$(x)bar   evaluates to    foo17bar
>>
  
  The special sequence `$$' represents the character literal `$'. That
is, the two-character sequences `\$' and `$$' are normally equalivalent.
  

B.1.6  String constants
=======================
   
  Literal strings are defined with matching string delimiters. A left
string delimiter begins with the dollar-sign `$', and a non-zero number
of single-quote or double-quote characters. The string is terminated
with a matching sequence of quotation symbols. The delimiter quotation
may not be mixed; it must contain only single-quote characters, or
double-quote characters. The following are legal strings.
<<
      $'Hello world'
      $"""printf("Hello world\n")"""
      $''''
  Large "block" of
  text # spanning ''multiple'' lines''''
>>
  
  The string delimiters are not included in the string constant. In the
single-quote form, the contents of the string are interpreted
verbatim--there are no special characters.
  The double-quote form permits expression evaluation within the string,
denoted with the `$' symbol. The following are some examples.
<<
      X = Hello
      Y = $""$X world""             # Hello world
      Z = $'''$X world'''           # $X world
      I = 3
      W = $"6 > $(add $I, 2)"       # 6 > 5
>>
  
  Note that quotation symbols without a leading `$' are not treated
specially by OMake. The quotation symbols is included in the sequence.
<<
      osh>println('Hello world')
      'Hello world'
      osh>println($'Hello world')
      Hello world
      osh>X = Hello
      - : "Hello" : Sequence
      osh>println('$X world')
      Hello world
>>
  
  

B.2  The OMake grammar
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  OMake programs are constructed from expressions and statements.
Generally, an input program consists of a sequence of statements, each
of which consists of one or more lines. Indentation is significant--if a
statement consists of more than one line, the second and remaining lines
(called the body) are usually indented relative to the first line.
  

B.2.1  Expressions
==================
  
  The following table lists the syntax for expressions.
   expr ::=                                             
            (empty)                                     
            -- Text (see note)                          
         |  text                                        
         |  string-literal                              
            -- Applications                             
         |  dollar `<char>'                             
         |  dollar `(' pathid args `)'                  
            -- Concatenation                            
         |  expr expr                                   
                                                        
 dollar ::= `$' | `$`' | `$,'                           
 pathid ::=                                             
            id                                          
         |  pathid `.' id                               
                                                        
    arg ::= expr -- excluding special characters `)(,') 
   args ::= (empty) | arg, ..., arg                     
  
  An expression is a sequence composed of text, string-literals,
variables references and function applications. Text is any sequence of
non-special characters.
  

B.2.1.1  Inline applications
----------------------------
  
  An application is the application of a function to zero-or-more
arguments. Inline applications begin with one of the ``dollar''
sequences `$', `$`', or `$,'. The application itself is specified as a
single character (in which case it is a variable reference), or it is a
parenthesized list including a function identifier pathid, and
zero-or-more comma-separated arguments args. The arguments are
themselves a variant of the expressions where the special character
`)(,' are not allowed (though any of these may be made non-special with
the `\' escape character). The following are some examples of valid
expressions.
  
  
 - `xyz abc'
 The text sequence ```xyz abc'''
 
 - `xyz$wabc'
 A text sequence containing a reference to the variable `w'.
 
 - `$(addsuffix .c, $(FILES))'
 An application of the function `addsuffix', with first argument `.c',
   and second argument `$(FILES)'.
 
 - `$(a.b.c 12)'
 This is a method call. The variable `a' must evaluate to an object with
   a field `b', which must be an object with a method `c'. This method
   is called with argument `12'. 
  
  The additional dollar sequences specify evaluation order, `$`' (lazy)
and `$,' (eager), as discussed in the section on dollar modifiers
(Section B.3).
  

B.2.2  Statements and programs
==============================
  
  The following table lists the syntax of statements and programs.
         params ::= (empty) | id, ..., id                               
        
                                                                        
        
         target ::= expr -- excluding special character `:'             
        
                                                                        
        
        program ::= stmt `<eol>' ... `<eol>' stmt                       
        
                                                                        
        
           stmt ::=

B.2.2.1  Special forms
----------------------
  
  The special forms include the following.
  Conditionals (see the section on conditionals --- Section 4.9). The
`if' command should be followed by an expression that represents the
condition, and an indented body. The conditional may be followed by
`elseif' and `else' blocks.
<<
      if expr
          indented-body
      elseif expr
          indented-body
      ...
      else
          indented-body
>>
  
  matching (see the section on matching --- Section 4.10). The `switch'
and `match' commands perform pattern-matching. All cases are optional.
Each case may include `when' clauses that specify additional matching
conditions.
<<
      match(expr)
      case expr
         indented-body
      when expr
         indented-body
      ...
      case expr
         indented-body
      default
         indented-body
>>
  
  Exceptions (see the `try' function in Section 8.2.7). The `try'
command introduces an exception handler. Each `name' is the name of a
class. All cases, including `catch', `default', and `finally' are
optional. The `catch' and `default' clauses contain optional `when'
clauses.
<<
      try
          indented-body
      catch name1(id1)
          indented-body
      when expr
          indented-body
      ...
      catch nameN(idN)
          indented-body
      default
          indented-body
      finally
          indented-body
>>
  
  The `raise' command is used to raise an exception.
<<
      raise expr
>>
  
  section (see the `section' description in Section 4.8). The `section'
command introduces a new scope.
<<
      section
          indented-body
>>
  
  include, open (see the `include' description in Section 4.7). The
`include' command performs file inclusion. The expression should
evaluate to a file name.
  The `open' form is like include, but it performs the inclusion only if
the inclusion has not already been performed. The `open' form is usually
used to include library files. [jyh-- this behavior will change in
subsequent revisions.]
<<
      include expr
      open expr
>>
  
  return (see the description of functions in Section 4.5). The `return'
command terminates execution and returns a value from a function.
<<
      return expr
>>
  
  value (see the description of functions in Section 4.5). The `value'
command is an identity. Syntactically, it is used to coerce a n
expression to a statement.
<<
      value expr
>>
  
  export (see the section on scoping --- Section 4.8). The `export'
command exports a environment from a nested block. If no identifiers are
specified, the entire environment is exported. Otherwise, the export is
limited to the specified identifiers.
<<
      export id ... id
>>
  
  while (see the `while' description in Section 8.3.42). The `while'
command introduces a `while' loop.
<<
      while expr
          indented-body
>>
  
  class, extends (see the section on objects --- Section 4.11). The
`class' command specifies an identifier for an object. The `extends'
command specifies a parent object.
<<
      class id
      extends expr
>>
  
  

B.2.2.2  Variable definitions
-----------------------------
  
  See the section on variables (Section 4.1). The simplest variable
definition has the following syntax. The `=' form is a new definition.
The += form appends the value to an existing definition.

      id += expr

      - : "1" : Sequence
      osh> X += 7
      - : "1" " " "7" : Sequence

  A multi-line form is allowed, where the value is computed by an
indented body.
<<

          indented-body
  
      osh> X =

      Y is HOME
      - : "/home/jyh" : Sequence
>>
  
  The name may be qualified qith one of the `public', `prtected', or
`private' modifiers. Public variables are dynamically scoped. Protected
variables are fields in the current object. Private variables are
statically scoped.
  [jyh: revision 0.9.9 introduces modular namespaces; the meaning of
these qualifiers is slightly changed.]
<<
      public.X = $(addsuffix .c, 1 2 3)
      protected.Y = $(getenv HOME)
      private.Z = $"Hello world"
>>
  
  

B.2.2.3  Applications and function definitions
----------------------------------------------
  
  See the section on functions (Section 4.5). A function-application
statement is specified as a function name, followed a parenthesized list
of comma-separated arguments.
<<
      osh> println($"Hello world")
  
      osh> FILES = 1 2 3
      - : 1 2 3
      osh> addsuffix(.c, $(FILES))
      - : 1.c 2.c 3.c
  
      # The following forms are equivalent
      osh> value $(println $"Hello world")
      osh> value $(addsuffix .c, $(FILES))
      - : 1.c 2.c 3.c
>>
  
  If the function application has a body, the body is passed (lazily) to
the function as its first argument. [jyh: in revision 0.9.8 support is
incomplete.] When using `osh', the application must be followed by a
colon `:' to indicate that the application has a body.
<<
      # In its 3-argument form, the foreach function takes
      # a body, a variable, and an array.  The body is evaluated
      # for each element of the array, with the variable bound to
      # the element value.
      #
      # The colon is required only for interactive sessions.
      osh> foreach(x, 1 2 3):
              add($x, 1)
      - : 2 3 4
>>
  
  Functions are defined in a similar form, where the parameter list is
specified as a comma-separated list of identifiers, and the body of the
function is indented.
<<
      osh> f(i, j) =
              add($i, $j)
      - : <fun 2>
      osh> f(3, 7)
      - : 10 : Int
>>
  
  

B.2.2.4  Objects
----------------
  
  See the section on objects (Section 4.11). Objects are defined as an
identifier with a terminal period. The body of the object is indented.
<<
      Obj. =
          class Obj
  
          X = 1
          Y = $(sub $X, 12)
          new(i, j) =
             X = $i
             Y = $j
             value $(this)
          F() =
             add($X, $Y)
          println($Y)
>>
  
  The body of the object has the usual form of an indented body, but new
variable definitions are added to the object, not the global
environment. The object definition above defines an object with (at
least) the fields `X' and `Y', and methods `new' and `F'. The name of
the object is defined with the `class' command as `Obj'.
  The `Obj' itself has fields `X = 1' and `Y = -11'. The `new' method
has the typical form of a constructor-style method, where the fields of
the object are initialized to new values, and the new object returned
(`$(this)' refers to the current object).
  The `F' method returns the sum of the two fields `X' and `Y'.
  When used in an object definition, the += form adds the new
definitions to an existing object.
<<
     pair. =
        x = 1
        y = 2
  
     pair. +=
        y = $(add $y, 3)
     # pair now has fields (x = 1, and y = 5)
>>
  
  The `extends' form specifies inheritance. Multiple inheritance is
allowed. At evaluation time, the `extends' directive performs inclusion
of the entire parent object.
<<
     pair. =
        x = 1
        y = 2
  
     depth. =
        z = 3
        zoom(dz) =
           z = $(add $z, $(dz))
           return $(this)
  
     triple. =
        extends $(pair)
        extends $(depth)
  
        crazy() =
           zoom($(mul $x, $y))
>>
  
  In this example, the `triple' object has three fields x, y, and z; and
two methods `zoom' and `crazy'.
  

B.2.2.5  Rules
--------------
  
  See the chapter on rules (Chapter 7). A rule has the following parts. 
  
 1. A sequence of targets; 
 2. one or two colons; 
 3. a sequence of dependencies and rule options; 
 4. and an indented body. 
  
  The targets are the files to be built, and the dependencies are the
files it depends on. If two colons are specified, it indicates that
there may be multiple rules to build the given targets; otherwise only
one rule is allowed.
  If the target contains a `%' character, the rule is called implicit,
and is considered whenever a file matching that pattern is to be built.
For example, the following rule specifies a default rule for compiling
OCaml files.
<<
      %.cmo: %.ml %.mli
         $(OCAMLC) -c $<
>>
  
  This rule would be consulted as a default way of building any file
with a `.cmo' suffix. The dependencies list is also constructed based on
the pattern match. For example, if this rule were used to build a file
`foo.cmo', then the dependency list would be `foo.ml foo.mli'.
  There is also a three-part version of a rule, where the rule
specification has three parts.
<<
      targets : pattern : dependencies rule-options
         indented-body
>>
  
  In this case, the pattern must contain a single `%' character. However
this is considered to be a sequence of explicit rules, where each target
is matched against the pattern, and a new rule is computed based on the
pattern match. For example, the following rule specifies how to build
the explicit targets `a.cmo' and `b.cmo'.
<<
      a.cmo b.cmo: %.cmo: %.ml %.mli
         $(OCAMLC) -c $<
>>
  
  This example is equivalent to the following two-rule sequence.
<<
      a.cmo: a.ml a.mli
         $(OCAMLC) -c $<
      b.cmo: b.ml b.mli
         $(OCAMLC) -c $<
>>
  
  There are several special targets, including the following.
  
  
 - `.PHONY' : declare a ``phony'' target. That is, the target does not
   correspond to a file. 
 - `.ORDER' : declare a rule for dependency ordering. 
 - `.INCLUDE' : define a rule to generate a file for textual inclusion. 
 - `.SUBDIRS' : specify subdirectories that are part of the project. 
 - `.SCANNER' : define a rule for dependency scanning. 
  
  There are several rule options.
  
  
 - `:optional: dependencies' the subsequent dependencies are optional,
   it is acceptable if they do not exist. 
 - `:exists: dependencies' the subsequent dependencies must exist, but
   changes to not affect whether this rule is considered out-of-date. 
 - `:effects: targets' the subsequent files are side-effects of the
   rule. That is, they may be created and/or modified while the rule is
   executing. Rules with overlapping side-effects are never executed in
   parallel. 
 - `:scanner: name' the subsequent name is the name of the `.SCANNER'
   rule for the target to be built. 
 - `:value: expr' the `expr' is a ``value'' dependency. The rule is
   considered out-of-date whenever the value of the `expr' changes. 
  
  Several variables are defined during rule evaluation.
  
  
 - `$*' : the name of the target with the outermost suffix removed. 
 - `$>' : the name of the target with all suffixes removed. 
 - `$@' : the name of the target. 
 - `$^' : the explicit file dependencies, sorted alphabetically, with
   duplicates removed. 
 - `$'+ : all explicit file dependencies, with order preserved. 
 - `$<' : the first explicit file dependency. 
 - `$&' : the free values of the rule (often used in `:value:'
   dependencies). 
  
  

B.2.2.6  Shell commands
-----------------------
  
  See the chapter on shell commands (Chapter 10).
  While it is possible to give a precise specification of shell
commands, the informal description is simpler. Any non-empty statement
where each prefix is not one of the other statements, is considered to
be a shell command. Here are some examples.
<<
      ls                                 -- shell command
      echo Hello world > /dev/null       -- shell command
      echo(Hello world)                  -- function application
      echo(Hello world) > /dev/null      -- syntax error
      echo Hello: world                  -- rule
      X=1 getenv X                       -- variable definition
      env X=1 getenv X                   -- shell command
      if true                            -- special form
      \if true                           -- shell command
      "if" true                          -- shell command
>>
  
  

B.3  Dollar modifiers
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
  Inline applications have a function and zero-or-more arguments.
Evaluation is normally strict: when an application is evaluated, the
function identifier is evaluated to a function, the arguments are then
evaluated and the function is called with the evaluated arguments.
  The additional ``dollar'' sequences specify additional control over
evaluation. The token `$`' defines a ``lazy'' application, where
evaluation is delayed until a value is required. The `$,' sequence
performs an ``eager'' application within a lazy context.
  To illustrate, consider the expression `$(addsuffix .c, $(FILES))'.
The `addsuffix' function appends its first argument to each value in its
second argument. The following `osh' interaction demonstrates the normal
bahavior.
<<
  osh> FILES[] = a b c
  - : <array a b c>
  osh> X = $(addsuffix .c, $(FILES))
  - : <array ...>
  osh> FILES[] = 1 2 3 # redefine FILES
  - : <array 1 2 3>
  osh> println($"$X")  # force the evaluation and print
  a.c b.c c.c
>>
  
  When the lazy operator `$`' is used instead, evaluation is delayed
until it is printed. In the following sample, the value for `X' has
changed to the `$(apply ..)' form, but otherwise the result is unchanged
because it it printed immediately.
<<
  osh> FILES[] = a b c
  - : <array a b c>
  osh> SUF = .c
  - : ".c"
  osh> X = $`(addsuffix $(SUF), $(FILES))
  - : $(apply global.addsuffix ...)
  osh> println($"$X")  # force the evaluation and print
  a.c b.c c.c
>>
  
  However, consider what happens if we redefine the `FILES' variable
after the definition for `X'. In the following sample, the result
changes because evaluation occurs after the values for `FILES' has been
redefined.
<<
  osh> FILES[] = a b c
  - : <array a b c>
  osh> SUF = .c
  - : ".c"
  osh> X = $`(addsuffix $(SUF), $(FILES))
  - : $(apply global.addsuffix ...)
  osh> SUF = .x
  osh> FILES[] = 1 2 3
  osh> println($"$X")  # force the evaluation and print
  1.x 2.x 3.x
>>
  
  In some cases, more explicit control is desired over evaluation. For
example, we may wish to evaluate `SUF' early, but allow for changes to
the `FILES' variable. The `$,(SUF)' expression forces early evaluation.
<<
  osh> FILES[] = a b c
  - : <array a b c>
  osh> SUF = .c
  - : ".c"
  osh> X = $`(addsuffix $,(SUF), $(FILES))
  - : $(apply global.addsuffix ...)
  osh> SUF = .x
  osh> FILES[] = 1 2 3
  osh> println($"$X")  # force the evaluation and print
  1.c 2.c 3.c
>>
